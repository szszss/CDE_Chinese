Level Distress Call at Luna	月球救援
Level Distress Call at Luna Description
	日安，上将，欢迎执行你的第一次指挥任务！不要在意那些关于所谓的裙带关系的绯闻。
	可能你还没有察觉到，近期USTA强占了几颗主小行星带中有领土争议的小行星，这导致了我们两国之间关系骤然紧张，总司令部的所有人 - 包括我在内 - 都一致认为局势还会继续恶化，这意味着我们要在几个月内动员每一位指挥官，所以你现在没有任何经验也不是个问题了！这次任务中，你的下级军官们会手把手地从零指导你轨道飞行的每一步。
	我们的一艘满载着珍贵的放射性矿物的货船，在从小行星带飞往月球的途中遇到了燃料泄漏事故，损失了全部的推进工质。万幸的是，它在燃料彻底漏光前设法进入了月球的高层轨道。船员已经修复了泄露的燃料罐，因此现在只要重新给货船加满燃料就可以了，月球是我们在太阳系中继火星之后，第二大的领土，所以我们在轨道上有大把大把的飞船和空间站可以对他们进行救援。
	你的任务就是指挥一艘停靠在储藏站的甲烷运输船，前去与失事的货船会合，为它加满燃料，然后带着它一起回到你出发的储藏站并做任务报告。这应该是一个很简单的任务了，今后还会有更困难的任务等着你呢，再强调一遍，有问题不要慌，你的军官们会一步步地指导你完成任务。
	啊，另外，请替我向你的母亲 - 我们敬爱的总统女士 - 问一声好！祝你好运！
Level Distress Call at Luna ShortDescription	为一艘在月球轨道上的遇险货船补充燃料，并带它回到空间站。

Level1Tutorial1	幸会，上将！在您手下服役是我最大的荣幸！我们先来学习一下如何控制游戏镜头。按住鼠标右键并拖动来旋转摄像机，或者您可以使用[W][A][S][D]键。
Level1Tutorial2	使用鼠标滚轮来缩小或放大视野，或者使用[Q][E]键。
Level1Tutorial3	按住鼠标左键并拖动来平移摄像机，或者按住[Shift]键然后按[W][A][S][D]。
Level1Tutorial4	按住鼠标中键并左右拖动鼠标来转动摄像机，或者按住[Shift]键然后按[Q][E]。
Level1Tutorial5	就是这样！我们再温习一遍，来漫游一下地月系吧。现在选中地球，先旋转镜头找到地球，然后左键点击它。
Level1Tutorial6	现在让我们把相机聚焦到被选中的对象，您可以点击这个按钮，或者按快捷键[C]。
Level1Tutorial7	很好！看看我们美丽的地球，她是如此的蔚...好吧，并不是那种通俗意义上的美丽。不管怎么说，我们这次任务跟地球没有什么关系，所以让我们回到月亮上吧，现在选择月球，如果你发现您选中月球后弹出的是一个菜单的话，这说明在屏幕上月球和其它物体重叠了。
Level1Tutorial8	然后再把相机聚焦到月球上。
Level1Tutorial9	干得好！另外，如果您想再次查阅之前的消息记录的话，您可以在这里查看。
Level1Tutorial10	准备好了的话，就关掉消息窗口。
Level1Tutorial11	在月球轨道上的菱形和正方形图标是您的舰队，选中有着菱形图标的舰队。
Level1Tutorial12	这是那艘遇险的货船。注意它的Delta-V为0，这意味着这艘太空船因为燃料耗尽而无法进行任何机动，它被困死在了它现在的轨道上。您的任务就是为它补充燃料。
Level1Tutorial13	我们再检查一下我们的救援舰队，选中正方形图标。
Level1Tutorial14	点击这个按钮来检查舰队，或者按快捷键[F]。
Level1Tutorial15	这支舰队由一座甲烷储藏空间站和一艘甲烷运输船组成，让我们检查一下运输船有多少Delta-V。
Level1Tutorial16	这艘运输船还可以装下更多的燃料，所以先让空间站给它加满燃料吧，现在选中甲烷储藏站。
Level1Tutorial17	现在启动甲烷储藏站的自动加燃料器，点击这里来启动它。
Level1Tutorial18	注意此时运输船的Delta-V会缓缓增加，这是因为储藏站在为它补充燃料，如果此时您关闭这个界面的话，加油最自动进行到加满为止。
Level1Tutorial19	我们还有一件事要做：将运输船和空间站分离成两个舰队，因为您没法拖着空间站去搞太空救援！在舰队检视界面点击这个按钮来将运输船标记为待分离单位。
Level1Tutorial20	很好！现在可以关闭检视界面，回到轨道界面了。
Level1Tutorial21	现在将镜头拉远到能够看见所有的舰队和它们的轨道，您可以看到遇险的货船正在外侧的高层轨道中，而空间站与运输船正在靠内的低层轨道。
Level1Tutorial22	时间充裕，我们先来看一下在太空中的轨道飞行是什么样子吧。点击右下角的‘运行片段’按钮，或者直接按[回车键]或[空格键].
Level1Tutorial23	如您所见，一小片段的时间过去了，舰队在沿着它们的轨道环绕月球飞行，你会注意到货船的轨道速度慢于运输船，这是因为在稳定轨道中，航天器在更近的高度中总是比更远的高度要快。
Level1Tutorial24	让我们把片段长度调到6小时吧。
Level1Tutorial25	再运行一个片段。
Level1Tutorial26	您可以灵活选择一个片段要运行多长时间，如果中途发生意外情况的话会自动暂停，现在，让我们将片段时间设为1小时。
Level1Tutorial27	现在是救援船出动的最好时机，请选中运输船，然后让我们开始规划航线。
Level1Tutorial28	点击这个按钮或按[T]来启动航线规划，您需要通过设计航线来改变轨道。
Level1Tutorial29	您会注意到原本绿色的轨道线现在变成了青色了，这就是舰队今后的航线。
Level1Tutorial30	如果此时您已选中了舰队，那么当您把鼠标移动到航线上时，您会看到“未来当舰队航行到此处时的天体位置”，当然也还会显示其他的舰队在那时候的位置 - 假如它们一直保持在原轨道上不动的话。
Level1Tutorial31	点击青色航线上的任意一处，我建议是点击距离你的舰队较近的地方。
Level1Tutorial32	在你选中一点会后，界面会显示当你的舰队航行至此时的情景。注意到红绿蓝三个球棍了吗？它们是用来控制推进器点火方案的。
Level1Tutorial33	蓝色的控制球用来控制离平面速度改变量，由于这次任务只涉及到二维平面上的变轨，因此不必考虑离平面，所以我强烈建议在本次任务中您不要乱碰这个控制球...
Level1Tutorial34	绿色的控制球用来控制径向速度改变量，可以理解为是靠近或远离环绕点...咳咳，或者您可以点击这个控制球来亲手试一下，试完后只要按鼠标右键或[ESC键]就能取消改变了。
Level1Tutorial35	红色的控制球用来控制切线速度改变量，这个是变轨时最常用的东西，主要用来扩大或缩小轨道。
Level1Tutorial36	选择切线速度控制球(红色)并扩大你的航线，直到航线与货船的轨道相交，你不用一直拖拽控制球，只要左键点一下它，然后移动鼠标，在得到满意的结果后再次点击左键就行了，如果效果不满意的话，可以按[ESC键]取消改变。
Level1Tutorial37	引擎燃烧量会显示在左侧，您可以点击红叉来取消掉不想要的变轨机动。
Level1Tutorial38	一旦航线与货船的轨道相交后，交点附近就会有个白色的星球图标，这代表在此时舰船已经靠得足够近，足以匹配入对方的轨道了，点击这个图标，然后选择匹配轨道。
Level1Tutorial39	很好，如果您的操作无误的话，航线会终止于白色菱形上，这代表舰队航至此处时就能进入那条轨道了。
Level1Tutorial40	确认无误后，运行片段直到救援船匹配入货船的轨道。
Level1Tutorial41	现在两船在同一个轨道了，但它们永远不会相遇，因为两船是在同一个轨道的两处，为了让它们相交，我们得主动让其中一方扩大或缩小轨道。
Level1Tutorial42	选中救援舰队，然后让我们进行一次轨道调相，请创建一个新航线方案。
Level1Tutorial43	选中青色航线中的任意一点，不过越靠近您的舰队意味着您的等待时间越短。
Level1Tutorial44	这一次我们依然只改变切线速度，调整切线速度控制球(红色)。您应该已经知道了当舰队在切线方向上加速时，轨道会扩大；当减速时，会缩小轨道。
Level1Tutorial45	随意拖拽一下，感受一下它的效果。
Level1Tutorial46	您可以随时将鼠标移动到航线上来显示此时您距离目标有多远，如果您的舰队是在目标的前面，那就放大轨道，让目标追上来；如果舰队是在目标后面，就缩小轨道来追上目标；如果舰队是在目标的正对面...我建议您先将舰队调整到一个不同的轨道，然后多等一会，等对方追上来，或者您追上了对方。按照这个原理，调整轨道，直到您看到一个绿色的交会图标，选中它来进行交会。
Level1Tutorial47	很好！绿色交会图标旁的菱形代表您的舰船会在此处顺利与遇险船只会合，运行片段直到两者顺利交会。
Level1Tutorial48	现在货船和甲烷运输船已经被自动编入一个舰队了，选择这个舰队。
Level1Tutorial49	检视它。
Level1Tutorial50	就像您用空间站给运输船加油的方式一样，用运输船给货船加满燃料。
Level1Tutorial51	然后再分离货船到独立的舰队，因为这次任务只要求我们把货船带回空间站嘛，哈哈。相信我，运输船的船员会自己找到回家的办法的。
Level1Tutorial52	现在返回到轨道界面。
Level1Tutorial53	注意此时货船的Delta-V，它现在已经有能力返回空间站了。
Level1Tutorial54	让我们设计一条返回空间站的新航线，请先选中货船的舰队。
Level1Tutorial55	这一次我们要来一些不同的操作，在轨道航天中，有无数种方案从一点飞到另一点。
Level1Tutorial56	同样的，在太空中也有无数种参考系，这一次让我们换个参考系，点击这里。
Level1Tutorial57	将参考系设置为甲烷储藏站。
Level1Tutorial58	现在舰队的航线会变得非常古怪，但实际上它并没有真的发生改变，这不过这里显示的是以空间站为固定观察者时，观察到的舰队航线。
Level1Tutorial59	重设参考系的意义在于，参考系的原点是永远不会移动的，你可以试试将鼠标移动到航线上任意一点，您会发现空间站永远不会移动。
Level1Tutorial60	选中航线中的一个点并规划新的变轨方案，同样的，我建议您依然选择距离您的舰队近一些的位置。
Level1Tutorial61	观察当您移动切线速度控制球(红色)时航线是怎么改变的。
Level1Tutorial62	在这个参考系中，您会发现在您操作时航线的变化很有悖于直觉，实际上轨道机动依然遵循着我之前提到的规则，只不过换了参考系后会看起来有些奇怪。如果您实在无法让航线与空间站交会的话，试试改变径向速度(拖拽绿色的控制球)。
Level1Tutorial63	使用红色和绿色的控制球(记住不要碰蓝色的，它是用来控制离平面的)，让航线尽可能近地经过空间站，直到出现绿色的交会图标，选择让两者交会。
Level1Tutorial64	规划完毕后，让我们把参考系换回月球。
Level1Tutorial65	选择月球作为当前的参考系。
Level1Tutorial66	以月球为参考系时，航线看上去就正常很多了，继续运行片段直到货船返回空间站。
Level1Failure	真不幸，您把这次任务搞砸了，但不用担心，重启任务，让我们再试一次吧。
Level1Success	任务完成！您已经掌握了轨道飞行的入门技巧，可以去执行更困难的任务了！

Level False Flag	自导自演
Level False Flag Description
	首先，请让我恭喜你在第一次任务中的出色表现，而且是一次及时的成功，因为就在眼下，我们有一份战斗任务要交给你，不必担心，我们为你提供的火力远胜过你的敌人，你的战术官也会手把手地指导你。
	几天之前，一艘属于太阳系联合贸易联盟的小型军舰据说叛逃了，并在木卫三附近袭击了我们的一艘货船，USTA拒不承认他们支持此类行动，但我们总司令部可不相信他们的声明，很可能这又是一次由USTA总部策划的挑衅行动，我们的谴责将会让我们在冲突中陷得越来越深。
	不过这是我们考虑的事情，你所要考虑的只是歼灭变节的星舰，木卫三是被多个势力共同控制，包括USTA在内的每一个太阳系中的势力都在木卫三有驻军，你将要指挥一艘位于木卫三轨道上的战舰去将敌舰轰成碎片，它的武器装备远胜于敌方，因此战斗的结果应该显而易见了。去吧，只要让你的战舰成功拦截到敌舰后，船员们应该就能处理剩下的事情了。
	你在这次任务中的敌手是USF的杰克·卡伦上校，一位以缺乏决断力却又鲁莽好斗而闻名的走卒，他干的唯一一件出名的事是在USTA攻略土卫二的战役中奉命攻击平民船。
Level False Flag ShortDescription	拦截一艘位于木卫三的敌舰并以压倒性的火力歼灭它。

Level2Tutorial1	您好，上将，不必为战斗担忧，现在，只管让战舰拦截到敌人的船只就好，战术官会指导您如何打赢战斗。
Level2Tutorial2	我还要提醒一下，此次任务中敌人的轨道是椭圆形而不是圆形，因此如果您还想重施上次任务的策略，通过轨道调相来追上敌人的话，我建议您在轨道的近地点进行机动以取得最好的效果。
Level2Tutorial3	还有一点，木星的引力会影响舰队的轨道，因此在变轨或轨道调相时要多花一些心思。
Level2Tutorial4	欢迎来到战场！游戏会在战斗开始时自动暂停，不过您可以在游戏选项里关掉这个设置。
Level2Tutorial5	首先，这里是测距面板，它显示了两军之间的距离，以及武器射程。白圈代表我方到敌人的距离，中间的箭头和数字表明了双方之间的相对速率和速度方向。
Level2Tutorial6	这里会告诉您我方会在多久后飞越敌舰(假设双方都保持现有速度)。
Level2Tutorial7	上面的红色菱形代表敌人，下面的绿色菱形代表您的战舰。现在选择您的战舰。
Level2Tutorial8	测距面板上的弧线代表武器射程，蓝色的弧线代表敌人在射程外，橙色代表敌人已经进入射程。
Level2Tutorial9	默认情况下所有武器都是自动开火，由于大部分武器都是安装在舰体两侧，因此一个常用的进攻策略是在进入射程后让战舰侧舷对敌，尽情输出伤害。
Level2Tutorial10	您可以点击这里来向舰船下达指令.
Level2Tutorial11	追击是让你的船以最大速度瞄准敌人径直撞上去，通常是用于导弹或无人机，如果您是给主力舰下达这个指令的话，确保在适当的时侯取消掉这个指令，否则就会真的同归于尽了。
Level2Tutorial12	现在选择敌舰。
Level2Tutorial13	在选择一艘敌舰后，测距面板会显示敌方的武器射程。.
Level2Tutorial14	您可以在这里要求炮手们集火射击敌方某个系统，一次性标定太多的目标会分散您的火力，因此我建议一次只标定一个目标，具体选择哪个目标，就有赖于您在战场上的战术决断了！
Level2Tutorial15	现在先随意下令集火一个他们的系统。
Level2Tutorial16	就这样了，您可以按[空格键]来解除暂停，祝您好运！
Level2Tutorial17	敌舰进入我们的射击范围了！现在，选中您的战舰。
Level2Tutorial18	此时，轨道炮的射程弧线是橙色而不是蓝色，这代表敌人已进入此武器的射程。
Level2Tutorial19	轨道炮位于战舰的侧面，在正面对敌时它们往往没有合适的射击角度，所以请点开这里来更改命令。
Level2Tutorial20	命令你的战舰侧舷对敌。
Level2Tutorial21	当敌人进入武器射程内后，武器就会自动开火，炮弹在命中敌人之前需要一段时间，因为我们两方之间间隔几十公里之远，按[空格键]来解除暂停。
Level2Tutorial22	敌舰中弹了！选中敌人的战舰来看看那里发生了什么。
Level2Tutorial23	在攻击敌人时，观察他们的窘态不只是心理上的快感，更能让您评估当前攻击方案的效果，如果您认为命中率不佳的话，尝试让炮手去瞄准更大更明显的目标。
Level2Tutorial24	您的战舰遭到攻击了！现在赶快选中它。
Level2Tutorial25	如果敌人的激光击中我们了，您不会看到任何明显的弹道特征，这是因为在真空中激光是不可见的，但是在激光命中的地方您会看到光斑和被融化的装甲。
Level2Tutorial26	我们受到严重伤害了！选择您的战舰。
Level2Tutorial27	注意我们刚刚损失了一个模块，很可能是敌方的激光武器的精确攻击效果。如果被摧毁的是炮塔的话，您可能需要下令对准方向来让战舰另一侧的武器能够继续攻击敌人。
Level2Tutorial28	我们击毁了敌人的一个模块！选择他们的战舰。
Level2Tutorial29	您可以在这里看到您刚刚摧毁的模块。
Level2Failure	你未能及时消灭叛乱的船只。
Level2Success	干得好！那个叛变的舰长现在再也不是个问题了。

Level Predatory Opportunism	血腥背刺
Level Predatory Opportunism Description
	考虑到你在上一次任务中的表现，我们总司令部认为你已经准备好去执行第一件危险的战斗任务了。哦当然，这一次你回来的也刚刚好。
	就在你迎击USTA在木卫三的‘叛变’船只时，我们发现了一系列的USTA侵略性行动，尤其是在主小行星带中。其中最值得注意的，是他们的一艘在小行星带巡逻的战舰在收到我们摧毁了他们‘叛变’船只的消息后，立刻掉转航向飞往水星。水星被我们和其他阵营联合管理，也是我们在战术运作上的关键支撑点。
	按照惯例，我们会向USTA发出威胁和警告要求他们不要侵犯我们的轨道空域，有时候还要再来一点贸易制裁，但到最后受损失最大的还是我们自己。
	然而问题来了，在近些年随着我们和太阳系联合贸易联盟的资产权利冲突越加严重，再加上他们在木卫三的侵略性行为，我们已经被迫做一些我们在正常情况下不会做的事情了。这一次，我们警告他们我们会直接摧毁擅入我们轨道空域的星舰，既然他们仍坚持这么做了，那我们也该兑现我们的警告了，你的任务是去摧毁那艘闯入水星轨道的战舰。
	水星是由我们和易洛魁复兴会共同控制，易洛魁复兴会是一个和USTA有着不愉快的过去的势力，我们总司令部正迫不及待地想利用这个优势，我们和他们达成了一个交易，他们关闭了水星上所有的星港，以换取我们遍布太阳系各地的燃料补给设施的使用权。
	现在，那艘敌舰正环绕在水星轨道上，无法靠港或着陆补充燃料，让它变成了一个坐以待毙的鸭子，正适合我们出击消灭它，我们在水星轨道上有一艘小型航母可以供你指挥，用它去把USTA战舰撕成碎片吧。
	不要理会任何他们发来的关于反击的警告，不要接受他们的投降，也不要理会他们关于水星轨道是非武装中立区的抗议。那艘战舰相当强力，它装备着射程相当远的线圈炮，事实上你有机会消灭它完全得益于对方缺乏燃料被困在了轨道上，我建议你保持你的旗舰在战斗范围外，线圈炮的射程远远长于你的旗舰上的任何武器，使用航母的无人机去消灭它。那艘敌舰由USF的阿勒科山德·周上校指挥，他是一个没有任何实战经验的菜鸟，但这不代表他不能在你的旗舰误入他的武器射程内时摧毁你。
	动作务必要快，USTA的支援舰队已经从小行星带出发了，我们估计你有15天的时间来完成任务，否则当敌方支援抵达时，我们不能冒险让你同一群燃料充足的敌舰交战，那时只能取消任务了。
Level Predatory Opportunism ShortDescription	摧毁一艘位于水星的离平面轨道的危险敌舰。

Level3Tutorial1	对于这次任务，上将，我建议使用无人机来消灭敌人，无人机的体积远比您的主力舰要小，因此它们可以靠近敌人而不会过早地遭受到火力拦截。
Level3Tutorial2	首先选中您的舰队，我会指导您如何发射无人机。
Level3Tutorial3	检视您的舰队，您可以使用快捷键[F]，也可以点击这个按钮。
Level3Tutorial4	您可以在无人机发射器的控制面板上发射无人机，并且决定发射的数量，默认情况下，他们在发射后会自动分离成一支独立的舰队，您可以点这个按钮来关闭自动分离。
Level3Tutorial5	需要注意的是，大多数无人机的Delta-V都很少，您可能需要让宿主船尽可能地接近敌舰的轨道，这样可以大幅减少无人机进行变轨时的Delta-V开销，比如在这次任务中，我建议您先让航母进入敌人的轨道，然后再发射无人机去截击敌人，否则的话，仅凭无人机自己的Delta-V很难变换到离平面轨道上。
Level3Tutorial6	放手去做吧，尽管实验新战术，找出一个最适合您的方案吧！
Level3Tutorial7	哦还有一点，通常来说无人机都会有一个默认指令，如果您希望将尽可能多的Delta-V留给战斗的话，可以取消默认指令，等敌舰进入射程时再重设指令，这样就可以避免无意义的机动浪费Delta-V。
Level3Failure	这次进攻失败了，在你摧毁敌舰全部的线圈炮之前，让你的主力舰保持在敌舰射程之外。
Level3Success	干得漂亮！我们在这场尚未开始的战争中取得了一个好的开始，上将。现在趁着对方援军还没到赶快撤退吧。

Level A Small Diversion	偶然意外
Level A Small Diversion Description
	我们的宣传机器已经开始将舆论引导到对我们有利的方向了，现在大半个太阳系都相信是USTA先开的火。正如我们所料，事态正如几个世纪前的福克兰群岛事件那样发展，USTA尚未对我们正式宣战，因此我们也没对他们宣战，但可以肯定的是，在接下来的几个月中肯定会有来自USTA的报复行动，因此我们也在全力备战以防他们不宣而战。
	在你这边，我们有一项新的任务要交给你，由于两国之间的冲突迫在眉睫，我们正在疏散所有位于USTA主要领土的军船民船，其中一艘科研船，由门多萨上校所指挥，正在飞往艾女星的路上，但是USTA控制着那个小行星上的每一座设施和轨道上的每一座空间站，因此我们要求那艘科研船立刻强行掉头返回智神星，当它进入智神星的轨道时，所剩的燃料已经寥寥无几了。
	然而我们在智神星附近并没有可调动的舰船，控制着大部分设施的新日本国拒绝为我们提供救援，我们怀疑是USTA迫使新日本国做出了这个决定，或许是通过金钱，或许是通过军事威胁。
	你的任务是指挥那艘科研船用仅存的那燃料前往我们控制的一座空间站，这可能有些紧迫，但我们确信你能办得到，而且这也是一次对你的轨道规划能力的锻炼。在他们的给养耗尽之前，你有15天的时间来完成任务。
Level A Small Diversion ShortDescription	利用极少的Delta-V让一艘环绕于智神星的科研船回到空间站上。

Level4Tutorial1	在这次任务中，您会发现哪怕很简单的机动都会耗尽舰船的Delta-V，燃料和时间的开销在变换轨道和航天器交会时总是存在的，然而这是您第一次因为没有足够的Delta-V而不能忽略这些开销。
Level4Tutorial2	为了最小化轨道机动的Delta-V开销，尝试在航线交会时让两者(舰船和空间站)保持一个尽可能相近的速度，您可以通过让航线以小角度插入目标轨道来实现，举个例子，当航线与目标轨道垂直相交时，进入轨道的开销是最大的，您可以理解为星舰不得不完全停下，然后再加速追上目标的轨道；而航线沿着目标轨道的切线插入轨道时开销是最小的，星舰在抵达交会点后只要做一点点机动就能完全进入目标轨道。
Level4Tutorial3	还有一个小提示，在自动计算舰队交会时，您不必精确点击绿色的交会图标，您点击绿色图标附近的任意位置都能选择在此地计算交会变轨方案，只不过耗费的Delta-V和时间会有所不同，这个规则对于其他同类指令，比如飞掠和拦截之类的也是适用的。
Level4Failure	我们完蛋了，谢谢你在最后一刻的努力，但我和我的船员们是没救了。
Level4Success	谢谢你！船员们已经开始担心我们要变成智神星轨道上的一个铁棺材了。下次在友港碰面时，我请你喝一杯。

Level Orbital Fallout	辐射星"尘"
Level Orbital Fallout Description
	正当你忙着疏散船只撤离USTA的星港时，似乎USTA有着完全相反的想法，一艘USTA的战舰在从土星起航后经过一段漫长的路途进入了爱神星的轨道，那是一个我们控制的小行星，毫无疑问这是一次公然的挑衅。
	尽管爱神星是一个非常小的小行星，我们在其上也没有多少人口，但事实上它有着重要的战略价值。
	只说一点，虽然我们在几乎所有的被我们控制的星体上都储备着武器，修建着星舰，但没有哪个的特殊性比得上爱神星，在爱神星的隐蔽船坞中，我们正在建造一条原型武库船，一个中等体积的主力舰，携带了数量惊人的核导弹，如果说我们有从大灾变中学到什么教训，那就是没有什么问题不能被核弹头解决的。
	显然，我们不能让我们的原型船落入敌人之手，但是我们所能调动的最近的战舰，是一艘位于王后星的护卫舰，要花费数以月计的时间才能飞过来，我们唯一所能做的，是让那艘几近完工的原型船立即下水去保护它自己，它还尚未填充燃料，但是已经填装上了一部分弹药和核导弹，这应该就足够了。
	来袭的USTA战舰是一艘装备核武器的导弹船，由USF的阿尔伯特·盖特纳上校指挥，我们没有此人的记录。我们之前已经多次向他发出警告，但他无视了我们所有的通讯。我们怀疑USTA已经探明了我们正在爱神星上建造原型船的情报，这也是为什么他们派盖特纳上校来到那的原因，所以我们毫不犹豫地决定要消灭他，但可以确定的是他也会毫不犹豫地与你交战。
	在这次任务中，你不必考虑Delta-V，你要做的就是待在轨道上尽情发射导弹，让导弹扑向敌人，记住当你的导弹掠过敌舰时速度越快，敌人能拦截你的导弹的时间就越少。
	你的任务就是消灭盖特纳上校的战舰，同时确保武库船和船坞不要被击毁。我们的宣传机器会处理这场太空核战的政治影响，所以不要犹豫，尽管把盖特纳上校变成一团辐射尘埃吧。
Level Orbital Fallout ShortDescription	保卫太空站，在不损失己舰的前提下摧毁敌舰。

Level5Tutorial1	这个任务是您第一次进行防御战，作为被动方，我的建议是先运行一个片段，看看对方打算出什么牌。
Level5Tutorial2	看起来对方打算立刻除掉您，当他们的导弹舰队拦截到您的舰队时，我们就会被拉入战斗界面。
Level5Tutorial3	当对方导弹来袭时，您应该发射热诱弹，热诱弹要持续发射，因为每一枚热诱弹只能维持有限的时间，但也不能发射太频繁，因为热诱弹的数量是有限的；同时您不能发射太早，这是一种浪费，但也不能发射太晚，否则不足以将敌人的导弹引到足够远的地方。
Level5Tutorial4	只要热诱弹的热量超过你的舰船本身的热信号，那么它就是有效的，这艘船的热信号就小于热诱弹的热量。此外，您还可以考虑用导弹来拦截导弹，通常来讲，1枚蹂躏者核导弹可以将一个导弹群削弱一半，记住当使用导弹来拦截导弹时，您需要择机手动引爆导弹，同时切记要关闭导弹的默认指令，防止它们因耗尽Delta-V而失效！
Level5Failure	我们在爱神星的战略物资已经被破坏到无法修复了。
Level5Success	千钧一发啊，上将。我们的造船工人们安全了，我们的原型船也保住了，可喜可贺！

Level Lagrange Point Graveyard	拉格朗日坟场
Level Lagrange Point Graveyard Description
	好吧，看来飞往小行星511的USTA舰队只不过是进行佯攻，它让我们从我们在小行星带的第二大要塞 - 谷神星转移了大量的战舰前往灶神星，然后它就调转航线直奔谷神星，我们只有一个月的反应时间，根本不足以召唤在外的战舰，也没有时间从别处调集援军。
	太阳系联合贸易联盟的战斗舰队抹平了我们在谷神星的防御舰队，除了它的旗舰。当战斗局势恶化时，残存的舰队牺牲了自己来掩护他们旗舰的撤退，慌忙之中旗舰进入了一个直奔太阳的自由落体轨道，所幸在最后关头它用残存的Delta-V进入了水星在地日系中的拉格朗日L_4点的蝌蚪形轨道，避免了一头扎进恒星的命运。
	坐在旗舰中的是我们尊敬的军事领袖，洋蒂·苏特查上将，谷神星防卫舰队的指挥官，他们仅剩下三个月的食物补给，毕竟他们也未曾料到会遇到这种情况，我们在水星轨道附近有一条甲烷运输船，指挥它在旗舰的补给耗尽前与其会合，之后我们会派更多的船去打捞旗舰，把他们带回水星，不过这是后话了，你这次的任务就是指挥运输船前去与旗舰会合，为他们运去至关重要的补给品。
Level Lagrange Point Graveyard ShortDescription	在补给耗尽前让救援船与位于水星的拉格朗日L_4点的遇险船只会合。

Level6Tutorial1	以防您还没发现，您可以通过这个按钮来开关拉格朗日点的显示，您会发现在这个任务中它非常有用。
Level6Tutorial2	全部的5个水星-太阳的拉格朗日点都已经显示出来了，然而，在这次任务中您只需关心L_4点，目标船只正被困在那里，现在请找到它。
Level6Tutorial3	目标船只正处于围绕这个点的蝌蚪形轨道当中，待会您可能需要将L_4点设为参考系。
Level6Tutorial4	首先您的救援船需要先逃逸出水星的轨道，并落入围绕太阳的轨道然后切入水星-太阳的L_4点，由于L_4点是在水星的“前面”，您需要让救援船进入一个半径小于水星公转半径的轨道，这样才能追上L_4点。
Level6Tutorial5	在规划航线时，您应该从距离太阳最近的那一点出发，这是因为救援船需要先向水星公转方向的反方向加速以落入恒星轨道，在离太阳最近的那一点只要加速就行了；若是在离太阳最远的那一点，则需要先减速再加速，这会浪费大量的Delta-V，而且还有一头扎进水星的风险。
Level6Tutorial6	只要选择了正确的点，通过改变切向速度(红色))来逃逸所要消耗的Delta-V会远小于改变径向速度(绿色)来逃逸所要消耗的燃料，我认为在最佳情况下，只要消耗不到1km/s的Delta-V就能逃逸出水星轨道了。
Level6Tutorial7	成功逃逸水星轨道的一个特征是航线一头扎向远方，而不是继续绕着水星转圈圈，等你完成了这个后，我们就该切换参考系了。
Level6Tutorial8	假定此时您的航线已经逃逸出水星轨道了，此时再以水星为参考系就没有意义了，将参考系设为太阳。
Level6Tutorial9	现在把视角缩放到尽可能的远，如果您成功从水星轨道中逃逸了出来的话，现在的轨道看上去应该是一个环绕太阳的原型或椭圆形，这说明您的救援船正围绕着太阳而不是水星公转。
Level6Tutorial10	现在您应该已经清楚之后该如何与他们交会了，祝您好运！
Level6Failure	看来你赶不过来了，真可惜，现在为你传输船员们的遗书录音，请务必送达他们的家人。
Level6Success	很及时，上将，感谢救援。

Level The Interamnian Incident	身陷囹圄
Level The Interamnian Incident Description
	好吧，这是一件非常不幸的事情，我们的一艘环绕于小行星704的战舰发生了哗变，叛乱的水兵囚禁了舰长，并占领了全舰。我们向你保证，这只是一次偶发意外，与我们的军事体系或其他任何事情都没有丝毫联系。
	叛乱的组织者，船上的大副，拉希米中校，提出了许多放肆的要求，你不必劳神去听他那些可笑的讨价还价，你只需知道的是他已成为国家公敌，他要付出的代价就是极刑，按照共和国的法律，这种高度叛国连审判都不需要。若是在平时，我们会建议你去接管最近的一条战舰，一艘重炮舰，去将拉希米的船轰成一个炙热的等离子体，没有什么可讨价还价的。然而这一次，却有一个问题。
	那艘战舰的原舰长是希塔·钱德拉上校，钱德拉议员的女儿，她的父亲即使不算这个国家中最有权的人，起码也是火星议会中权力最大的参议员，用核弹炸了他的女儿将会是一场灾难，尤其是他掌控着的稀有金属开采是决定这场战争走向的关键。
	故此，我们要谨慎处理这件事情，但是拉希米仍必须死，因此计划是让你指挥战舰设法接近并瘫痪掉叛变的船只，精确破坏掉他们的引擎和武器系统，然后我们就能派出跳帮队进入船员仓消灭掉叛乱的水兵，救出被囚禁的钱德拉上校。要破坏他们的武器系统，你可以选择将船壳上的炮塔一个个摧毁掉，也可以选择直接击毁他们的发电设备；而对于引擎系统，你可以选择击毁引擎，也可以选择打穿他们所有的工质罐，这样他们就会因为没有燃料而失去行动能力。
	我必须再向你强调一次，那艘船的船员仓必须毫发无损！如果钱德拉上校真的在交火中遇难了，我们只能设法编造一个故事，将锅甩给USTA或其他什么人，但我不觉得她老爹会买账，一旦他发现真相，我怀疑不仅你的母亲都保不住你，可能连她的政治生涯都会受到负面影响了。
Level The Interamnian Incident ShortDescription	瘫痪掉位于小行星704的哗变船只，但不要摧毁它。

Level7Tutorial1	为了能精确瘫痪敌舰，上将，我建议在战斗时做这两件事情：关闭我们威力过强或精度过低的武器，然后瞄准关键的部位开火。
Level7Tutorial2	即使尚未处于战斗，我们仍能在检视敌舰队时提前标定要攻击的模块。
Level7Tutorial3	记住，如果我们没有指定任何一个精确攻击目标的话，我们的炮手就会自由开火随意攻击敌舰的任意模块，这可不是一次外科手术式的精确打击所该做的。
Level7Tutorial4	还有一件重要的事情，如果是我来执行这种任务，我会选择一次只标定一个射击目标！这是因为如果同时向多个系统开火的话，弹幕式的火力很可能会直接摧毁掉整个舰船，这样的话我们就把任务搞砸了。
Level7Tutorial5	当你选定了一个射击目标后，就返回吧。
Level7Tutorial6	我们再来看一下我们的舰队。
Level7Tutorial7	检视它。
Level7Tutorial8	您拥有导弹发射器，激光炮，还有一些线圈炮和轨道炮，您需要关闭一些威力过大或精度过低的武器。
Level7Tutorial9	另外，导弹的工作原理是瞄准最大的热源，这意味着它们不会受您当前设置的优先攻击目标的影响，除了不建议您手动发射导弹以外，我还建议您直接关掉导弹发射器模块，以防在战斗时它自动发射。
Level7Tutorial10	为了判断哪种武器最合适，您可以尝试在战斗中只启动一种武器，然后关掉其他的，逐一循环并观察每种武器的攻击效果。
Level7Tutorial11	最后再给您一个提示，战斗开始时双方的位置是根据两支舰队中射程最远的武器来决定的，考虑到我们有无法发挥的射程优势，您可以提前关闭那些长程武器，这样战斗就会发生在更近的距离。此外，对于长程实弹武器而言在近距离射击并不吃亏，因为实弹武器的精度是与射击距离成反比的，在近距离发射实弹武器虽然浪费了射程，但也提高了精度。祝您好运！
Level7Taunt	你是指挥官？你不是总统的孩子吗？听我说，不要开火，我们不必要靠暴力收场，我会告诉你们我这么做的理由！不要开火，听我说！共和国总司令部一直在向你们撒谎！他们 --- <传输被干扰>
Level7Failure	你打爆了船员仓！上校死了！当钱德拉议员发现真相时，恐怕你的军旅生涯就要告终了...
Level7Success1	我已经命令船员放下武器了，我们投降。再一次的，你用行为证明了是什么样的人在控制着共和国。
Level7Success2	做得好，上将，我们会立刻部署跳帮队。

Level Force Projection	力量投送
Level Force Projection Description
	我们先谈谈上一次任务，你出色地控制了局势，钱德拉父女对你的评价都非常高。你要相信自己做了正确的事情，我们已经发现拉希米中校一直在收取一个与USTA有关系的匿名渠道的资金援助，除此之外，我们还发现他涉及了多起腐败、行贿、甚至是性骚扰案件，总而言之，他是个绝对的坏蛋，消灭他是你做的一件绝对正确的事。
	言归正传，你的下一个任务是迎击USTA迫在眉睫的攻势，他们非常大胆地派遣了一小支舰队进入了火星的高层轨道，绕着火星转圈圈与我们保持对峙，火星是我们的总部所在地，我们当然有充足的火力去抹平那支舰队，但考虑到如此小的一支舰队居然敢于踏进马蜂窝，总司令部对此感到有些不祥的预感。
	这可能是一次简单的力量投送，向我们展示他们有能力随时斩首我们的高层，迫使我们有所忌惮，或许这是另一次佯攻，要引出我们藏在地下掩体中的火星防卫部队，又或者这只是一次侦察行动，甚至还可能是其他我们想不到的目的。
	总而言之，总司令部不喜欢有一支舰队在我们头顶上晃荡，可想而知火星的百姓也不会乐于听到这个消息，我们需要立刻消灭这支舰队，但我们计划使用尽可能少的火力，这样就不会暴露我们的真实实力，也避免他们有什么其他的阴谋诡计。你的任务就是指挥一艘航母去消灭敌方舰队。
	情报指出敌方的指挥官是塔蒂阿娜·万哈宁准将，一位有案可查的指挥官，有着一定的实战经验，她最出名的行动是与你之前在木卫三击杀的卡伦上校一道血洗土卫二，她的记录指出她优先采用防守策略，并且偏好保守的战斗风格，因此她将舰队部署到了火星的离平面逆行轨道上，迫使她的对手（也就是你）要花费大量的Delta-V来拦截她。
	在你消灭万哈宁准将的舰队后，向我们做任务报告。
Level Force Projection ShortDescription	拦截并摧毁一支位于火星的离平面逆行轨道上的敌方舰队。

Level8Tutorial1	您可能会发现这次的任务有些棘手，首先，先检视敌人的舰队。
Level8Tutorial2	敌人的舰队是由一艘激光护卫舰组成，激光武器的特点是射程和精度不会因目标的体积而改变，这一点与实弹武器有很大不同，我们的无人机对上激光武器时就失去了它们的体积优势了。
Level8Tutorial3	您你瘫痪敌人的激光器之前，您发射过去的无人机都不太可能在被击毁前能对敌人造成任何伤害。
Level8Tutorial4	记住瞄准敌人的激光武器模块，现在返回轨道界面。
Level8Tutorial5	这是您第一次指挥多艘舰船作战，先来检视舰队，看看您的游击舰吧。
Level8Tutorial6	您的游击舰装备了实弹武器和核导弹，我建议您通过导弹齐射来击瘫敌人，切记不要挤牙膏！如果您一次只发射几枚导弹的话，敌人的激光武器可以轻松地拦截它们，只有几十枚导弹齐射才有希望突破激光武器的反导网。
Level8Tutorial7	现在再来看看航母。
Level8Tutorial8	除了自卫用的实弹武器外，航母可以发射无人机，这些无人机可以轻易消灭失去了激光武器的敌人，只是要记得它们的Delta-V很少。
Level8Tutorial9	总结地说，我们有三张牌：导弹、无人机和我们的主力舰，现在返回轨道界面。
Level8Tutorial10	最后还要提醒您一件事，注意敌人轨道上箭头的方向。
Level8Tutorial11	您会发现敌方舰队的飞行方向是与您相反的，我们称此为逆行轨道，如果您想进入一条逆行轨道并与对方同向而行的话，您需要先掉头停下来然后再追上敌人，这意味着您要花费将近两倍的Delta-V！
Level8Tutorial12	您当然可以尝试强行掉头然后追上敌人，最简单的方式是在即将于对方轨道相交的时候减速，然后再向对方轨道的切向方向加速，直到进入对方的轨道。
Level8Tutorial13	但是仍有一种更简单的方式，那就是直接进入对方轨道而不管方向，也就是逆向而行，在两军相遇的那一小段时间窗内决出胜负！如果要这样做的话，就不要选择红色的自动拦截指令了，请使用橙色的飞掠指令。
Level8Taunt	愿最好的指挥官胜出，共和国的上将。
Level8Failure	祝你下次好运，共和国的上将。
Level8Success	你对局势处理的非常好。万哈宁准将只能活在人们的记忆中了，干得好，上将。

Level Uranian Cargo Run	天王快递
Level Uranian Cargo Run Description
	USTA的行动相当缓慢，甚至他们的反应速度都要慢于我们的行动速度。因此在目前为止，唯一的主要战斗只有谷神星战役，不幸的是他们赢了，而且看上去他们依然相当谨慎。我们会很快对谷神星展开反攻，但在此之前我们需要你先为我们做一件事。
	我们的入侵部队需要更多的铀燃料来填充他们的引擎和反应堆，以及更多的钚来生产核弹头。天卫五，一颗由我们和新日本国联合控制的小行星，是最大的裂变物质供应地，我们与新日本国的关系愈发紧张，最初他们是想在我们和USTA的战争中保持中立，但现在他们正和USTA走的越来越近。
	考虑到这一点，我们要你现在立刻将天卫五开采并储藏的裂变物质运输到天王星最外侧的主要卫星，天卫三上。既是为了防止新日本国打这批战略物资的主意，也是为了让这批物资尽管送达谷神星远征舰队，由于天卫三是冥王星系统最远处的燃料补给站，只要你能在20天内将货物送达，后续计划应该都能正常进行。
Level Uranian Cargo Run ShortDescription	指挥一艘从天卫五出发的货船进行卫星间转移，前往位于天卫三的货运站。

Level9Success	我的员工们已经开始为货船补充燃料了，他们会重新优化飞船的质量配置，让它尽快与谷神星特遣队会合。干得漂亮，上将。

Level Retaking Ceres	夺回谷神
Level Retaking Ceres Description
	是时候去执行你的第一次硬碰硬的任务了，这一次我们要把谷神星夺回来。
	敌人的数量远超过我们的入侵舰队，考虑到敌军出没在小行星带的各处，我们真的没法从火星或灶神星给你调集更多的援军了，你只能用这仅有的兵力去完成任务，幸好拜你上次任务的努力，这支舰队已经整备完毕，载满了来自天卫五的核物质，尽管这个优势并不明显，但我们相信已经足够让你消灭敌人夺回谷神星了。
	当入侵舰队抵达谷神星的轨道后，他们会抛掉外挂工质罐并将指挥权移交到你手上，你有一个月的时间消灭掉所有在轨敌舰来完成任务。
	一旦夺回谷神星后，我们又将重新获得小行星带的控制权，然后我们就可以去考虑更大的目标了，比如主动向敌方领土发起进攻，而不是疲于防守。
	你在这次任务中的敌手是联合太空军中最臭名昭著的帕维尔·苏利文少将，太阳系联合贸易联盟首相的侄子，他习惯于进攻型的策略，而且也善于节约使用Delta-V，他最近一次的战斗是在谷神星战役中击败了我们的苏特查上将，他不习惯防御战，而更倾向于主动攻击敌手，不过我们认为在这场战斗中这将会是他的一个死穴，希望你能好好利用他的这个缺点。
	武运昌隆，让我们的人民能为之骄傲吧！
Level Retaking Ceres ShortDescription	用一支较少的舰队摧毁位于谷神星的大型舰队。

Level10StartTaunt	你处于绝对的劣势，上将。如果你要投降的话，我会接受的。
Level10CombatTaunt	最后一次投降的机会，上将。别怪我没警告过你。

Level Homecoming	归家路漫
Level Homecoming Description
	你在谷神星打了一次漂亮的战斗，上将。然而，在我们开始发起反攻之前，还有一件在你夺回谷神星时发生的事情。
	还记得希塔·钱德拉吗？你从哗变的水兵中救出的那个上校，由于她的船已经被除役，大部分船员又因为参与哗变而被处决了，她在那次事件后一直处于闲职，我们让她暂住在司理星，一颗在小行星带中由我们控制的大石头，直到我们找到一条可供她指挥的新船。然而，就在你夺回谷神星时，USTA派遣了数支小型舰队前来进攻多颗小行星，其中就包括司理星。
	其中一支舰队正直奔司理星而来，我们在那里并没有驻军，附近也没有可供调动的舰队，那里的船坞主要由自由贸易公会来运作，他们拒绝让我们的舰队靠港，以表现他们在这场冲突中的中立立场。
	因此，你需要指挥一艘民船来协助钱德拉上校撤离司理星，并带她回到火星，你的目的地是一个位于火星轨道上的自由贸易公会空间站，从那她就可以自己搭乘通勤艇回到地面了，你的出发点是司理星轨道上的自由贸易公会船坞，他们虽然保持中立，但也是一群通‘钱’达理的商人，我们在这次任务中为你准备了一笔经费，用这些钱从他们琳琅满目的船坞中直接买一条好船吧。
	她的父亲，钱德拉议员，考虑到战争正越来越白热化，已经特别点名要让她留在火星防卫舰队，我们在火星的舰船库存大概还够维持2年，因此请在限定的时间内将她送到火星。
Level Homecoming ShortDescription	将一位VIP从司理星送到火星轨道上的空间站。

Level11Start	上将，我之前一直没来得及感谢你将我从叛军之中救了出来，谢谢你。虽然我不是很乐意被明升暗贬去指挥防御舰队，但我明白这与你无关。这次还要有劳你送我回到火星，真是辛苦你了。

Level11Success	谢谢你带我的女儿回来，上将！明年的总统选举我会无条件地支持你的母亲。

Level Main Belt Extraction	敌中作敌
Level Main Belt Extraction Description
	当你忙着送钱德拉上校返回火星时，发生了一些有趣的事情。
	一艘USTA战舰进入了林神星的轨道，那是一块位于主小行星带、处于我们控制下的大石头。那艘孤舰正与我们的驻军进行静坐战争，等待后继的援军抵达。
	但就在对峙时，我们收到了一条从船上发来的私密广播信息。
	信息似乎是USF的内森·习平少校发送的，一位舰上的高级军官，他似乎有意归顺到我们这一方，并且愿意为我们提供有价值的情报 - 只要我们能带他活着离开。
	一般来说，我们不会贸然进攻一艘如此强大的旗舰，然而，我们也不能忽略习平少校的情报的价值，我们总司令部迫不及待地想要知道他葫芦里卖的是什么药，一艘服役于主小行星带的旗舰是任何USTA战斗计划中的中流砥柱。
	你的任务就是带着你从林神星所能获取到的任何战舰去瘫痪掉敌舰，只要击毁敌舰的引擎或者工质容器就能让它无处可逃，之后再击毁掉它的武器系统或供电系统，这样我们的跳帮队就可以席卷他们的舰桥了。
	这次任务时间非常紧迫，你只有不到一天的时间来完成任务，一旦敌方增援抵达，我们就再也没有机会了。

Level Vesta Overkill	血战灶神
Level Vesta Overkill Description
	USF的习平中校为我们提供了有价值的情报，情报指出USTA正在策划对灶神星展开一轮大规模攻势，由于他‘被俘’了，因此他们似乎开始加快脚步提前展开行动，他们的入侵舰队已经从土星起航，习平的另一条不那么让人愉快的情报则指出USTA已经窃取了我们的武库船的设计，生产出自己的版本了，并且就在入侵舰队之中。
	显然，他们希望通过压倒性的火力与核导弹优势来歼灭灶神星的防卫部队。
	灶神星是我们除谷神星以外，在小行星带最大的领土，它的战略价值仅次于我们在火星和月球的工厂群，我们不能失去灶神星，因此我们调集了附近的一切力量来抵挡敌人的攻势。
	敌人的舰队是由全USTA太空部队的二把手，USF的切莱斯蒂娜·"血战者"·沃提科上将指挥的，她以她的鲁莽和缺乏克制而闻名，显然她会试图以最快的速度用压倒性的火力消灭你。
	此外，我们还检测到有一条新日本国生产的切割者型战舰包含在他们的入侵舰队中。
	你的任务就是抵御敌人的进攻，并消灭来犯的舰队，注意，虽然这是一场防御战，但并不代表你有无限多的时间去进行阻滞作战，一旦她疲于与你捉迷藏了，她肯定会毫不犹豫地用核弹抹平我们在灶神星上的城市！
Level Vesta Overkill ShortDescription	抵挡住敌人在灶神星的攻势，并歼灭掉所有来犯之敌。

Level13Failure	真是轻松，我跟货船打仗都比这刺激。
Level13Success	干得好！太阳系联合贸易联盟的小行星带入侵舰队被全歼了，现在我们是小行星带的主要控制者了。

Level On the Surface of Giants	巨星之上
Level On the Surface of Giants Description
	再一次的，恭喜你抵挡住了沃提科上将的攻势。我们相信，她的战败将是这场战争的转折点，谷神星和灶神星都已被我们牢牢地控制住了，USTA在小行星带的行动已经被压制到最低限度了，游荡在其中的游兵散勇被我们歼灭是迟早的事情，现在小行星带已经不再是我们的主要前线，从现在开始，我们将采用进攻策略，我们要将战线推进到他们的门户。
	我们先要进行一次小规模的行动，这一次的目标是防守薄弱的气态巨星 - 海王星，我们可以轻易攻下他们在冥王星或阋神星的殖民地，但这些矮行星的易手对太阳系政局不会有什么显著的影响，而且对我们用途也不大，而海王星至少是一个有价值的目标，它是一个资源丰富的地方，唯一可惜的是它实在是太远了。
	习平的情报指出USTA在当地的主要防御力量都集中在海卫一的轨道上，这也是我们所预料到的，但是情报也指明了一个我们没意料到的，那就是整个海王星的军事行动都依赖于位于海王星大气层上空的甲烷仓库，从海王星大气层中收集到的甲烷都被储存到这个空间站中，如果我们能摧毁掉这个由杰西卡·特拉洛克少校监管的仓库，他们的防御舰队就会被困死在海卫一上，然后我们就可以放心大胆地进攻海王星其余的卫星，而不必担心他们的反击。
	感谢我们的政治家与他们掏不干净的钱包，我们与易洛魁复兴会再次达成了一个协议，他们在海王星的卫星波吕斐摩斯上有一个秘密基地，他们允许我们指挥一支小型舰队去摧毁那座甲烷储藏站，如果你的火力不足以击毁整个空间站的话，你的最低要求是击毁太空站的船员仓，这样那座空间站就会失控并一头扎进海王星的大气层中。
	但是你的时间并不充裕，我们预计在USTA反应过来之前，你只有4天的事件。当你完成任务后，我们在天王星待命的入侵舰队会立即动身。
Level On the Surface of Giants ShortDescription	摧毁一个位于海王星甚低轨道上的空间站。

Level14CombatTaunt	USTA万岁！

Level Solar Ties	太阳之盟
Level Solar Ties Description
	不管怎么说，这终于发生了，USTA与新日本国走的如此之近，贸易活动如此紧密，以至于刚刚新日本国与USTA达成的针对我们的军事联盟一点也不令人吃惊，我们入侵海王星的行动得先暂停了。
	根据新日本国的最终通牒的措辞来看，他们并不打算与我们进行全面战争，他们是想通过对我们在小行星带以内的领土施加军事压力来帮助改善他们和USTA的贸易关系，我们估计可能是因为我们同USTA的战争刺激了新日本国，让数百万新日本国国民陷入了贫困，甚至更糟糕的境地，因为我们沉重打击了他们的主要食物、空气、淡水供应伙伴 - USTA。显然，我们在与USTA的战争中不会考虑对新日本国的经济会造成什么损害，因此现在我们也不会选择让步或谈判，我们不会妥协，我们所要做的就是与他们战斗！
	现在，一支来自智神星的大型舰队正浩浩荡荡地开往金星，指挥者是NSF的藤冈安上将，尽管从分析来看她习惯采用进攻型战术，但金星可能是个特例，考虑到它强劲的引力，在这种地方采用激进的机动会是一种自杀性的行为，因此她可能会更加小心谨慎一些。特别的，这次行动并没有其他迫在眉睫的威胁，因此作为防守方的你没有任何硬性的时间限制，尽情地玩弄她吧。
	再总结一遍，你的任务是消灭全部来袭的敌舰，保证金星的安全。另外由于金星轨道上遍布着我们的制造厂，你在配置舰队时有很充裕的质量和经费预算。
Level Solar Ties ShortDescription	摧毁一支正在进入金星轨道的新日本国舰队。

Level Dusk Over Triton	夜降海卫
Level Dusk Over Triton Description
	新日本国的入侵已经被挫败了，你让他们灰溜溜地回去舔舐自己的伤口，现在我们得重新谈谈海王星了。
	由于你之前成功破坏了海王星的主要补给线，我们顺利地让一支入侵舰队没有遇到任何抵抗就进入了海王星行星系统，舰队停驻到了海卫二的轨道上，也就是海王星系统的最边缘，在重新整装后，他们已经准备好行动了。
	USTA的防御舰队都集中在海卫一的轨道上，离海卫二有相当的一段距离，你的舰队在启航后需要从海卫二航行到海卫一的轨道上，并摧毁全部的USTA舰队，由于你已经摧毁了海王星的甲烷补给站，USTA不得不从土星派出增援舰队，我们预计在他们的援军到来之前你有3个月的时间来完成任务。
	我们的记录表明敌方指挥官是USF的杰斯珀·帕卡瑞少将，一位性情古怪，偏好进攻的指挥官，他的经典战术是将舰队一分为二，分头行动，他的大部分同僚，以及我们自己的战术分析师，都认为这是个糟糕的点子，但他能活到现在，一定或多或少有那么些绝活，他这辈子大部分时间是花在与易洛魁复兴会发生领土冲突时在海王星的轨道上互掷核弹，我们关于此人的大部分情报都是从他们阵营内部获得的二手情报，因此对于以上的话，你不可全信。
	一旦这个人和他的舰队被全歼后，海卫一，乃至整个海王星系统，都将属于我们，届时木星和土星将会是USTA仅剩的地盘。
Level Dusk Over Triton ShortDescription	指挥一支舰队从海卫二出发前往海卫一歼灭敌舰队。

Level The Jovian Lunar Tour	木卫之旅
Level The Jovian Lunar Tour Description
	海王星是我们的了！USTA仅剩的兵力主要盘踞在木星和土星轨道上，我们要先清理他们在木星的舰队。在这几年间那里的局势越来越失去控制了。
	你还记得苏特查上将吗？我们尊敬的舰队司令，由你从水星的拉格朗日点救回来的那位。当你忙于攻占海王星时，她被指派负责木星战役，由于木卫三这个木星主动脉是被多个势力联合控制，因此从冲突之初它便是我们和USTA（之后又加上了新日本国）的绞肉机，现在其上的大部分城市都已经变成了散发着辐射的冒烟窟窿了，虽然木卫三已经失去了战略意义，但我们仍不得不去争夺剩下的卫星，苏特查设法消灭了大部分敌舰，但代价是赔上了几乎全部的木星舰队，她不得不下令舰队撤退回木卫四与她本人的旗舰会合。
	然而就在木卫四的轨道上，苏特查被舰上的一个叛徒刺杀了！毫无疑问是USTA一手策划的！你被指派去接管指挥并完成她尚未完成的任务。你有两个月的时间在USTA下一批军舰下水前去歼灭木卫一和木卫二上的敌方舰队，不幸的是，在整个行星系中，唯一一艘尚有战斗力的舰船只有苏特查的旗舰。
	不过也请不要过于担忧，敌人仅存的只有几艘小型主力舰，在战斗中应该不会对你造成太多的威胁，你所要考虑的只是如何逮到他们的舰队。
	位于木卫一和木卫二的敌舰队是由USF的以斯拉·杜伽准将和埃伯利·史密斯少将分别指挥，两人的战斗风格都十分谨慎并且以防御为主，这已被他们之前与苏特查的战斗所证明了。考虑到他们大部分的战舰都已经被摧毁了，我们认为他们不太可能采取主动的进攻行动。
	最后还有一个好消息，我们总司令部已经和自由贸易公会达成了一个协议，你现在可以使用他们位于木星-木卫二的拉格朗日L_4点的甲烷补给站了，这应该能为你缓解不少燃料压力。
	啊，还有，请代我向你的母亲祝贺她成功连任共和国总统！

Level17Success2	干得漂亮！苏特查的在天之灵会为你完成她的未竟事业而骄傲的！现在我们已经控制了土星卫星群的轨道了，那些所谓的抵抗斗士就请他们吃原子弹吧！不管怎么说，再一次感谢你为共和国的付出！

Level The Fall of Titan	泰坦陨落
Level The Fall of Titan Description
	就是这样了，我们占领了木星轨道，自由贸易公会察觉到了我们势在必得的胜利，开始全力支持我们的战争，他们为我们提供了足够的补给，让我们重新武装了木星攻略舰队，因此，盘踞在木星卫星群上的残敌们已经不再是威胁了，这意味着土星将是USTA最后的抵抗据点。
	就在刚才，USTA已经请求我们的总司令部派出一位特使，并递上了一份有条件投降书，但我们对此并没有兴趣，你想想，一份有条件投降就意味着他们能休养生息，有机会重建并重组舰队，在十几年或几十年后，再次打造出一支强大的军事力量，然后又要再一次重演对我们的入侵，再一次挑战我们对太阳系的领导地位，如果我们以铲平他们城市来威胁他们接受无条件投降，我们就可以一劳永逸地终结他们的威胁。
	USTA一定要屈服于我们，我们会接管他们全部的人口，占领他们全部的领土，那时，我们将是太阳系唯一的超级大国，也将是全人类的统治者，因为一旦USTA倒下，我们对新日本国压倒性的经济优势足以轻易击垮他们的经济，此时此刻，他们还在争夺小行星带，我们其余的舰队司令会去解决掉这些倭寇，而你将要率领一支矛头部队直捣土星，由于我们其余的军队都在全力防守新日本国对小行星带的入侵行动，你只能用我们所能给你的资源来准备土星入侵行动。
	不过仍有一些好消息，我们的盟友，易洛魁复兴会，也嗅探到了血腥味，他们果断抓住USTA败退的机会，出动了他们那小小的舰队，攻下了恩克拉多斯，也就是土卫二。显然他们迫不及待地准备在USTA彻底倒下时前去吞占USTA在土星卫星群的领地，为了向我们示好，他们为我们提供了一个在土卫二轨道上的补给点，因此你的进攻舰队将从土卫二出发。
	USTA的最高指挥官，布赖恩·杰弗逊元帅，在意识到土星防线已经出现了一个缺口后，匆忙率兵逃到泰坦 - 土卫六并组织对他们首都米泽让米亚市的防御。尽管他们已经将全部的舰队聚集在土卫六的低轨道上，我们仍不敢使用除土卫二以外的卫星作为入侵舰队的补给点，因为他们很可能在每一个卫星下都隐藏了对太空导弹井。杰弗逊元帅以他的小心谨慎与偏好防守而闻名，正好与你在灶神星击杀的他的副官沃提科上将相反。不必恐惧，我们相信在心理上他才是该害怕的那一方，现在他是他们阵营中最后一个将领了。当你归来时，我们会以英雄的待遇来欢迎你，只要你能设法消灭他。
	一旦杰弗逊元帅成了泰坦轨道上的一个冒烟的尘埃后，USTA的末日就真的到了，他们最后的太空部队也战败了，我们与其他的小势力，比如自由贸易公会和易洛魁复兴会，将会瓜分土星的卫星，新日本国的经济很快就会崩溃，届时，我们将是最后的胜利者，我们将会是站在对手残骸上的人，太阳系将会是我们的！
	让我们为之骄傲；让你的母亲，我们的总统，为之自豪；让我们成为太阳系中最伟大的势力！
Level The Fall of Titan ShortDescription	指挥一支从土卫二启航的舰队歼灭所有位于土卫六轨道上的敌方目标。

Level18Start1	你就是那个在小行星704杀了拉希米中校的人，对吧？你当时真的应该听听他说的，他告诉你的是真相。
Level18Start2	当然，你已经杀了这么多人了，我猜哪怕你已经听过了，也不会在意的。
Level18Combat1	你的母亲知道你对太阳系，乃至对人类造成的伤害吗？
Level18Combat2	凭一己之力让人类倒退一百年的感觉舒服不？你真的为你的所作所为感到自豪？
Level18Failure	你的进攻被挫败了，但你对人类造成的伤害将会成为一道永远不会愈合的伤痕。
Level18Success1	我最后的愿望...是有朝一日，你的母亲能明白...明白她造下的最大的孽就是...将你带到这个世界上...

	随着他们的主力舰队被歼灭，USTA的太空军已经支离破碎了。
	我们的增援舰队已经进入了土星轨道，正在有条不絮地清除那些溃军。偶尔会有几处小麻烦，某些地方有零星的抵抗，一支USTA舰队甚至还有胆子现在才冒出来请求投降。他们，都会被歼灭殆尽。
	我们会将他们一网打尽，不只是为了巩固我们的霸权，而是要把他们变成一个榜样，让别人知道反抗我们的下场。
	真相就是，我们不只是想要USTA的无条件投降，我们想要的，是看着他们统统跪下，祈求我们的仁慈！
	USTA的投降书上的每一条条款都会成为对敢于挑战我们地位之人的警告，只要在历史中留下你的无情，今后的威胁就会自然平息。
	我们怀疑新日本国已经重新考虑是否结束未来的敌对行为，但愿USTA的毁灭能迫使他们今后在做出鲁莽的行为前再三考虑。
	我们的共和国已经占领了太阳系的全境，我们会打造它，让它经受住时间的试炼。

Ending2Message1
	此时此刻，我们已经控制了USTA所有的卫星和小行星的轨道。他们的最后一道防线是他们的地面部队：士兵，大炮，和埋藏在地底的导弹井。
	但是呢，这完全不值得担心。
	还记得很久以前你在爱神星救下的那条原型武库船吗？没错，现在是时候展示它真正的用途了，我们的量产型武库船已经进入了土星轨道，此时它们正迫不及待地完成它们的使命。
	它们正逐一将敌人的空间站化为尘埃，它们正用核子火焰将USTA的地下掩体与地壳融化成一体，无穷无尽的核爆光芒盖过了太阳，我真希望你能在此留步欣赏这番烟火盛宴。
	如此多的军事行动多亏了你才得以成功，总司令部对你在这场战争中表现出的忠诚表示赞赏，你的名字会在共和国的每一座城市中传唱，你的声望将会传遍整个太阳系，你已被称作人民的英雄。
	我们的宣传行动会确保如此。

Ending2Message2
	哦对了，有一条总统女士发给你的信息，现在为你传输。

Ending3Message
	至我最亲爱的女儿，
	我现在是如此地为你骄傲，为你这么多年来所做的一切。当我坚持要让你在共和国太空军任职上将时，议会称此为腐败，但通过一次次的成功，你让他们每个人都把话收了回去。
	这些年间，对战争的政治支持曾经很不稳固，但通过你一次次的军事胜利，议会中的多数才下决心将战争进行下去。而且你的成功也巩固了我的政治地位，如果这场战争形势不利的话，我恐怕就会输掉下一次选举了。
	事实上，我曾一度担心我将会是自由人民共和国的最后一任总统，在战争开始之初，USTA胜券在握地对我们发起了偷袭，短时间内侵占了我们大部分领土。在你的帮助下，我们稳住了阵脚，让USTA永远不会奴役我们。
	我知道你一直在困惑于你在这场战争中扮演的角色，但我想让你知道的是，你只是做了正确的事情，我们早已度过了无路可退的难关，现在我们即将赢得胜利，和平又将降临于太阳系。忘掉那些内疚吧，因为我们胜利了。敌人已经被消灭了，你的工作结束了，而我的工作 - 治理这片战火肆虐过后的世界 - 才刚刚开始。
	不要在意那些反对派的陈词滥调。历史会把我们称为将太阳系统一在同一面旗帜下的二人，从我的仁慈与你的无情中，我们将会引出一个和平与繁荣的新纪元。
	你是个英雄，我们人民的救世主，太阳系的征服者，而且最重要的，是你拯救了我的仕途。我亲爱的女儿，任何辞藻也不足以表达我对你的感激、对你的骄傲、对你的爱。
	最好的祝愿，
	总统女士

Faction Republic of the Free People AbbreviatedName	RFP

Faction Republic of the Free People Description
	自由人民共和国(Republic of the Free People)成立于大灾变后的地球疏散行动，尽管当时许多前主权国家都竭力维持自己的政权，但在劫后余生的一片混乱中它们都几乎全部解体了。共和国是由多个前主权国家的遗民组成，成立之初是作为一个临时的国家联合组织，就像当时如雨后春笋般冒出的同类组织一样。最初的共和国主要由这四个国家的人口组成：印度尼西亚、印度、巴基斯坦和菲律宾。
	在共和国的早期，不同国家之间的理念差异几乎差一点毁了它，这样的一个联盟也只能靠着大灾变亡国灭种的威胁才能勉强维持。数以百万计的人口被疏散到了太空，民族之间的差异最终被淡化了，在经过几十年的融和后整个国家终于变成了一个整体。
	共和国的第一批公民主要来自于印度和巴基斯坦，得益于这两国的天钩能以极其低廉的成本将一箱又一箱的人口发射入LEO(地球低轨道)，送进如沙丁鱼罐头一般拥挤的太空难民营。由于天钩比其他手段便宜将近一个数量级，世界各地被抛下等死的人都蜂拥而至印度尼西亚，一掷千金只求一张登上天钩的船票。
	许多年过去了，疯狂的全民大撤离也终于平息了，各个国家联合组织发现他们现在甚至比自己身为主权国家时的政府还要团结一致，此外他们大多都是由来自不同国家的人口组成，于是到最后，这些联合组织保留了下来，在许许多多年之中随着人类从LEO和月球开始向全太阳系扩张的脚步，被带向了全星系。
	共和国的总部位于火星，同时它在小行星带也有数百个殖民地，其他主要的领主包括月球和天王星的几颗卫星，此外，他们是最靠近人类的昔日故乡地球的阵营，是LEO实质上的控制者，不像其他阵营，共和国对其余行星的影响力非常低，特别是卫星群被大量殖民的四颗气态巨星，许多阵营为了争夺那里丰富的资源而打的不可开交。

Faction United Sol Trade Alliance	太阳系联合贸易联盟
Faction United Sol Trade Alliance AbbreviatedName	USTA
Faction United Sol Trade Alliance ShipPrefix	USF
Faction United Sol Trade Alliance Description
	太阳系联合贸易联盟(United Sol Trade Alliance)，简称USTA，是一个在大灾变中形成的联合组织，它是由前地球的北欧亚社会主义共和国(North Eurasian Socialist Republic)、东亚国(East Asian Megastate)和几个企业国家组成，其中NESR是旧世界的超级霸权之一，这个在苏联崩溃百年之际出现的政权很快就与隔壁的EAM开始了第二次冷战。
	由两个昔日死敌组成的联盟确实很让人跌破眼镜，这两个一手导致大灾变的国家在结盟后开始扮演与之前相反的角色，这引来了很多猜疑和阴谋论。
	其中最有意思的理论是大灾变以及之后的地球疏散行动都是被预先策划好的，这是为了迫使人类离开母星这个监狱，让人类更加坚毅，成为一个星际种族。
	然而实际上更有可能的情况是两个国际中的极端民族主义者都早已经在大灾变和之前的战争中死光了，大多数剩下的活人在见证了自己一手带来的灾难的恐怖后早已经丧失了对抗下去的欲望，因此，与其在断壁残垣之中与对方用石头和棍子打个你死我活，还不如早早握手言和，一起携手翻开人类历史的新的一页。
	无论这个联盟是怎么形成的，日后越来越多渴望逃离地球的国家也加入了这个联盟，日益壮大的USTA体量已经远远超过最初形成时的两个国家，而最终它也是唯一一个保持着联盟政体的联合组织。
	USTA是第一个向太阳系外围进行疏散的阵营，当自由人民共和国在将他们的人口安置在月球、火星和小行星带时，USTA花了一年又一年的时间将他们的人口安置在了木星和土星的卫星群上，有时他们的难民甚至要在殖民船中待上数年之久，其他阵营很快就紧随他们的脚步，向冰和甲烷资源丰富的天王星和海王星展开了殖民。
	在过去的百年间，USTA一直保持侵略性的殖民和资源扩张政策，开采着每一颗他们占领的卫星和小行星，在太阳系中人类所能抵达的最远的地方，比如阋神星和妊神星建立殖民地，拜他们毫无意义的策略所赐，他们是柯依伯带绝对的控制者，因为其他阵营都没有蠢到要去探索这些遥远的天体，此外，他们向太阳系内部的扩张最远是在水星轨道上的几个空间站，在整个主小行星带也遍布着他们的殖民地和哨站。
	至今，他们是太阳系中最大的阵营，拥有第一的GDP和领土数量。

Faction Iroquois Resurgence	易洛魁复兴会
Faction Iroquois Resurgence AbbreviatedName	IR
Faction Iroquois Resurgence ShipPrefix	ISF
Faction Iroquois Resurgence Description
	易洛魁复兴会(Iroquois Resurgence)的出现对全人类来说都是个意外，在大灾变过去80年左右，所有阵营都已经将太阳系瓜分完毕时，原本是作为USTA的一部分的易洛魁复兴会突然公开宣布了他们的存在，并立刻从USTA中独立了出去，在独立时，他们控制着数颗海王星的卫星以及几颗小行星。
	USTA几乎是同时发出了武力统一的威胁作为回应(至少是比信息传播的光速要慢一点)，然而在当时，没有人任真研发过太空军事装备，IR-USTA是第一次大规模的太空军事冲突，成为了未来的每一场太空战争的预演。USTA试图发挥他们丰富的在地球上的海陆空战争经验，但很快就发现旧的经验完全不适用于这场新型战争，特别是太空战争的后勤运作要比地面战争困难几个数量级，第一场战争最后结束于一艘又一艘的战舰在烧光了他们的工质罐后搁浅于太空中，变成了环绕太阳系天体的一个个铝棺材，真正实质发生的战斗少之又少。
	最后USTA放弃了战争，转而采用简单的贸易制裁作为报复，时至今日，易洛魁复兴会仍是一个规模很小但实力不弱的阵营，在太阳系中控制着数颗卫星和小行星。

Faction The Liberty Exchange	自由贸易公会
Faction The Liberty Exchange AbbreviatedName	LE
Faction The Liberty Exchange ShipPrefix	LSF
Faction The Liberty Exchange Description
	自由贸易公会(Liberty Exchange)是一个由多个独立小行星和卫星组成的松散的邦联，其目的是相互帮助维持一个自由、中立的贸易联盟，这一点与太阳系联合贸易联盟不同，后者是一个依靠政治手段而非经济纽带来维持单一政权，而自由贸易公会则是一个地地道道的商人同盟。
	自由贸易公会由数百个或大或小的公司组成，最初作为一个公司间维持联系的松散组织，但到最近，它才将自己的身份定位为一个正式的政治联盟。
	作为一个坚定的资本主义联盟，以及对战争的厌恶，他们在大灾变之后的每一场冲突中都努力保持中立，然而，批评者很快就指出真相是在每一场冲突中，自由贸易公会都扮演着在幕后给冲突双方提供贷款和军火贸易的角色，对资本主义来说，这也并不让人意外。
	更敏锐的人甚至发觉到自由贸易公会从不“偏袒”战争中的某一方，他们会避免让任何一方因为自己的“帮助”而占据过大的优势，以至于让战争过早结束，毕竟战争打得越久，他们能捞到的油水就越多。有意思的是，自由贸易公会还是太空核武器的坚定反对者，并且坚决反对使用核武器攻击有人居住的星体，这倒不太可能是因为他们善良，而是因为担心使用核武器会让战争结束得更早。
	更有意思的是，他们是第一个公开反对人类建立单一币种的阵营，他们唯一承认和使用的货币是各种加密币，旧地球时代的比特币遗留下来的衍生品，曾被大量用于非法交易中，依仗着他们绝对的经济优势，他们在早期所做的努力终于让加密币将政府支持的币种驱逐出了太阳系市场。
	就像他们强烈地反对中央化一样，自由贸易公会还在公司间设立了大量的制衡措施，大多数成员公司会监视市场并联合制裁那些一家独大的企业，以防止他们膨胀得过于强大，因此尽管缺乏中央政府的监管，迄今为止仍未有一家公司能垄断太阳系中的任何一个市场，这是一个不稳定的制衡，权力被谨慎地在一小撮企业间分享，但至少在这几十年中这个制度还未曾出过差错。
	自由贸易公会努力抓住每一个商业机会，尽管他们主要的精力是投在建设供人居住的城市和太空城。颇有争议的是，由于他们对一切潜在商机的狂热执着，或者至少说他们拒绝任何一种赚钱的机会，现今他们是太阳系中的奴隶交易和黄色产业最大的经营者。
	'交易只是手段，赚钱才是目的'是他们的座右铭，恰好说明了他们所谓的资本主义的天性。
	他们的据点零散地分布在太阳系各地，主要都是在小卫星或小行星上，此外他们在很多较大的卫星和行星上也和其他阵营联合控制着许多小的“中立区”，作为一个公司联盟，他们没有中央化的总部，不过他们最大的领土是木卫三上的孟菲斯光斑市，那里是木星经济圈的贸易中心。

Faction Nippon Prime	新日本国

Faction Nippon Prime ShipPrefix	NSF
Faction Nippon Prime Description
	可以说是目前唯一一个由单一的旧地球国家演变而来的阵营，新日本国(Nippon Prime)是一个从旧地球的日本演变而来的太空国家，也是唯一一个历史能追溯到大灾变之前的阵营，在大灾变之前的日本，由于同朝鲜半岛统一保护国(Unified Korean Peninsular Protectorate)之间日益增加的压力，一个叫新日本党的右翼政党踏上了政治舞台，意图恢复国家的军国主义传统，这个政党的幕后支持者是国家庞大的军工复合体、机器人工业、仿生植入物工业以及最重要的太空工业。
	当大灾变爆发时，新日本党早已涉足太空，从土星和天王星的卫星群到数颗小行星，太阳系多处都被新日本党以科研名义建立了小型殖民地。而当包括总理大臣在内的日本领导层核心人物们撤离地球时，他们搭乘的飞往日本天钩的火箭在发射后爆炸解体了，这一意外成了在新日本党把持下的日本航天事业中，原本近乎完美无瑕的发射记录里唯一的一次致命事故。
	日本政府核心人物们的意外身亡大大增强了新日本党的政治控制力，在灾难后的重新选举中，新日本党赢得了选举，并安置了一位激进的首相上台。随着日复一日对人类灭绝灾难的恐吓式宣传、对振兴国家救国存亡的许诺，新日本党顺利解散了民选政府，并建立了一个君主制政权，新日本党正式成为新日本国，以强硬的态度踏入了太阳系政治舞台。
	新日本国大部分领土位于土星和天王星的卫星群，此外，作为USTA的主要贸易伙伴，他们还和USTA保持着紧密的关系，他们在小行星带以内也拥有少数几处领土，但其存在感远远弱于其他在着重经营那里的阵营，在USTA和IR的第一次太空战争过去的多年间，新日本国进行了多次针对比它弱小的阵营的军事行动，通过威胁乃至武装入侵的手段吞并了一个又一个弱小的阵营。
	新日本国由不朽女皇木下麻美领导，此人的记录可以追溯到200年前，早在旧地球时代，她便是新日本党的领袖。她能活如此之久的原因尚未被外界所知，有人猜测新日本党/国开发了远超市面上同类的续命手段；还有一种说法是现在的女皇只不过是当初的木下的一个克隆，当旧的女皇变老或意外死亡时，新的克隆体就会被放出来接任；还有一种说法是现在的女皇其实是一个以假乱真的机器人，真的女皇早已经死去很久了。

Concept Delta-v	Delta-v
Concept Delta-v Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Delta-v Description
	Delta-v, or change in velocity, measured in meters per second (m/s), usually in kilometers per second (km/s), is a measure of impulse needed to execute orbital maneuvers. Delta-v is not a rate of change, it is a measure of how much a ship's velocity can change. Every time a ship executes a thruster burn, such as during a mission, an amount of delta-v is spent. Each ship has a delta-v budget, which is the total velocity that that ship can alter its current velocity.
	Although delta-v is a measure of propellant left, it is the same for all ships. However, how much propellant each amount of delta-v is equivalent to varies by ship. For example, for a small ship, 1 kiloton of propellant might equal 3 km/s of delta-v, while for a larger ship, 1 kiloton of propellant might be only 1 km/s of delta-v.

Concept Basic Orbital Mechanics	Basic Orbital Mechanics
Concept Basic Orbital Mechanics Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Basic Orbital Mechanics Description
	The higher an orbit (i.e. the further away from the orbited body an object is), the slower an object moves. Thus, to speed up, lower your orbit. To slow down, raise your orbit. This necessarily means that objects in lower orbits will move much faster than objects in higher orbits, and as a result, will have more maneuvering options. At the same time, the lower and faster your orbit, the more delta-v it costs to change anything about that orbit. Orbital height is a tradeoff between maneuverability/speed and delta-v cost.
	The most efficient way to raise or lower an orbit is through a burn tangential to the orbited object and in line with the current velocity. This is usually done with the red thrust manipulator.

Concept Orbital Inclination	Orbital Inclination
Concept Orbital Inclination Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Orbital Inclination Description
	An inclined orbit is one that is not coplanar with another orbit. Switching between two orbits that are not in the same 2D plane is extremely costly in terms of delta-v.
	The most efficient way to switch between them is to burn at one of two points where your current orbit intersects the plane of the target orbit. The easiest way to find these two points where the planes intersect is to look at one of the orbits side-on, so that they both appear to be intersecting flat lines. The flat lines will intersect each other at exactly two points, and these two points are where inclination burns are most efficiently made. Note that this will not be the fastest way to reach a target, only the most delta-v efficient way.
	If you wait until your trajectory is at one of these two points, you can use the out-of-plane (blue) thruster manipulator at that exact point. If executed successfully, one can transfer planes and no longer need to use the out-of-plane thrust manipulator.
	On a different note, using an out-of-plane target as a frame of reference can be very difficult, and so there is an visual option to project the current trajectory on to the frame of reference's plane (upper left corner). This means that the trajectory will be drawn a second time in dark blue as if it were in plane with the target. This allows the dark blue trajectory to be plotted first, and then later, the actual trajectory can be matched using out-of-plane burns.

Concept Retrograde and Prograde Orbits	Retrograde and Prograde Orbits
Concept Retrograde and Prograde Orbits Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Retrograde and Prograde Orbits Description
	A prograde orbit is an orbit which matches the rotation of the body it orbits, while a retrograde orbit runs in the opposite direction. Most orbits in the solar system are prograde, matching the rotation axis of their orbited body.
	Switching from a prograde to retrograde orbit, or vice versa, tends to be very expensive in terms of delta-v. To make such a switch, simply use the tangential red thrust manipulator and pull the orbit into the reverse direction of travel until a backwards ellipse or circle is formed.
	Perfectly planning a retrograde combat intercept is akin to hitting one bullet with a second bullet in the opposite direction. One tiny nudge of the target ship can cause your ships to miss the intercept by kilometers or worse due to the enormous speeds. Additionally, combat will often go by so quickly that one won't have time to actually react to anything that happens in such a case.

Concept Lagrange Point	Lagrange Point
Concept Lagrange Point Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Lagrange Point Description
	Every body that orbits another larger body has up to five lagrange points. These are points of gravitational stability between the two celestial bodies where a spaceship or anything really can rest.
	The first two points, L_1 and L_2 are located very close to the smaller body, while L_3 is located on the opposite side of the larger body. However, L_1, L_2, and L_3 are all unstable, which means they require constant stationkeeping to stay in them.
	L_4 is located in an equilateral triangle planar with the orbital plane, with the smaller body and the larger body forming two corners of the triangle, and L_4 forming the third corner. L_5 forms another equilateral triangle in the opposite direction (but still coplanar). Both L_4 and L_5 are stable, so ships can keep an orbit around them without spending fuel to stationkeep. L_4 and L_5 are zones rather than single points because they are stable, which means the entire general area can support ships and stations.
	When a ship orbits the L_4 and L_5 points, their orbits can take on any number of interesting shapes, from figure eight orbits to tadpole orbits to horseshoe orbits, relative to the smaller body. Note that these shapes do not move relative to the smaller body; all Lagrange Points are static relative to the smaller body, and orbit the larger body like any celestial body would.
	To reach any of the Lagrange Points from the smaller body, aside from L_1 and L_2, one needs to escape the gravity well of the smaller body, and enter an orbit around the larger body. For instance, to reach the Earth-Luna L_5 point while orbiting Luna, one would have to exit Luna's orbit and fall into Earth's orbit to reach that zone.

Concept Orbital Escape Description
	Escaping the gravity well of a celestial body simply involves applying enough delta-v to achieve a hyperbolic trajectory about that body. Escaping that body's gravity well will leave your spacecraft in orbit of the parent body's gravity well.
	When making an escape from a circular orbit, for instance, it is intuitive that the wider the circular orbit is, the easier it is to escape, because wider orbits are slower than tighter orbits, thus, less delta-v is needed to break free. However, what may not be immediately obvious is that not every point on that circular orbit is equal in terms of delta-v needed to escape.
	A circular orbit is moving in a perpetually changing direction at a constant speed. If you wish to exit that circular orbit in a certain direction, the best place to exit would be at the point where the circular orbit's tangential velocity is already in the direction you wish to go in. In that case, you already have the orbit's high speed pay for some of the delta-v cost. In the worst case, when you are going the opposite direction as your orbit, you will have to essentially pay the delta-v needed for a retrograde orbit, and then the exit delta-v cost.
	Thus, waiting until you are at the right place in your orbit can save you delta-v when making an orbital escape. The downside is that you have to wait until you're at the right point on your orbit, which can be a problem when you have a tight time limit.
	A final note about exiting a body's gravity well: much as tangential burns are the most delta-v efficient way of changing orbital height, tangential burns are also the most delta-v efficient way of achieving escape velocity. Once again, this is not necessarily intuitive, as one might think burning directly away from the body would be most efficient.

Concept Orbital Elements Description
	Every orbit around a celestial body can be described as a circle or an ellipse around that body. If it is circular, the orbited body is at the very center of that circle, but if the orbit is elliptical, the orbited body is at one of the foci of the ellipse, meaning that the ellipse is unsymmetric in terms of distance to the orbited body. This is why there is an apoapsis and a periapsis for elliptical orbits. See apsis for more information.
	Every orbit can be described using six orbital elements: Eccentricity, Semimajor Axis, Inclination, Longitude of the Ascending Node, Argument of the Periapsis, Mean Anomaly at Epoch.
	The Eccentricity of an orbit describes how elliptical it is, with zero being circular, and flattening into an ellipse as it approaches one. An orbit with an eccentricity greater than one is hyperbolic, meaning it does not orbit the body at all, and is instead executing a flyby.
	The Semimajor Axis of a body indicates the average major distance to the body's center, which for a circular orbit is simply the radius of the circle.
	The Inclination of an orbit is how inclined it is to a relative plane. If it is zero, the orbit can be thought of entirely in a two-dimensional fashion, relative to the plane it is in.
	The Longitude of the Ascending Node indicates exactly in what direction an inclined orbit is oriented. For instance, two orbits may have an inclination of 45°, but they will not be coplanar if their Longitude of the Ascending Node elements are different, as the 45 degree inclinations will be facing different directions. Obviously, this is irrelevant if the inclination is zero.
	The Argument of Periapsis indicates where the periapsis is along the orbit; in essence, how the orbit is rotated after the inclination is applied. This is irrelevant if the orbit is circular, since there will be no apsis.
	Mean Anomaly at Epoch is the final element, and it simply indicates where along the orbit the orbiting body is, relative to some point in time (the Epoch).

Concept Hyperbolic Trajectories	Hyperbolic Trajectories
Concept Hyperbolic Trajectories Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Hyperbolic Trajectories Description
	Whenever a circular orbit is accelerated in, it becomes elliptical, and the faster one accelerates an orbit, the more elliptical it becomes. At a certain point, the eccentricity of that orbit exceeds one, meaning the orbital is no longer elliptical, and it is instead hyperbolic. An orbit which has an eccentricity of exactly one is parabolic, which is exactly in between elliptical and hyperbolic, but it's a rare case and not very relevant.
	Hyperbolic orbits are not truly orbits, because they don't periodically circle the target body, they simply approach the target body and then fly off in an escape trajectory. The amount of velocity required to achieve a hyperbolic trajectory from an orbit is called the escape velocity, because upon acheiving a hyperbolic trajectory, one escapes the orbited body's gravity well.
	A hyperbolic trajectory to a celestial body is simply an elliptical orbit to the parent body. For example, a hyperbolic trajectory about Luna would be an elliptical orbit around Earth, and a hyperbolic trajectory about Earth would be an elliptical orbit around Sol, and a hyperbolic trajectory about Sol is actually an elliptical orbit around the Milky Way Galactic Core.
	Missiles are often fired in hyperbolic trajectories at enemies, because the trajectory is faster, and there is no need to ever swing around a second time. If the missiles miss, they are not reused. They do not appear as orbits around the nearest body, instead appearing as straight lines because that truly is their path relative to that body. To achieve a hyperbolic trajectory, nothing special needs to be done; simply apply copious amounts of delta-v.

Concept Apsis	Apsis
Concept Apsis Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Apsis Description
	Any elliptical orbit has two apsis: the apoapsis, which is the point on the orbit furthest from the orbited body; and the periapsis, which is the nearest point on the orbit to the body.
	Circular orbits have no such apsis, because all points on the orbit are equidistant from the orbited body.
	Assuming an elliptical orbit with apsis, the velocity at the periapsis is the highest, and the velocity at the apoapsis is the lowest, as the orbital speed is directly related to the distance to the orbited body. The significant velocity difference between the two apsis is often unexpected, and not necessarily intuitive, since in highly elliptical orbits, the orbiter will zoom through the periapsis, and then spend a very long time at the apoapsis.
	A good mnemonic to learn apsis to think "apo" is similar "apart", so the apoapsis is the further apart point of the ellipse, while the periapsis is the closest point of the ellipse.

Concept Hill Sphere	Hill Sphere
Concept Hill Sphere Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Hill Sphere Description
	All celestial bodies have a roughly determined region of stability, called the Hill Sphere, which very approximately determines the region of stability for orbits around that body. Objects orbiting the body outside of this region will be unable to hold a stable orbit, even with stationkeeping. Outside the Hill Sphere, orbits will decay until the orbit becomes an orbit around the parent body. For instance, if orbiting Luna outside of Luna's Hill Sphere, the orbit will decay until the orbit becomes an orbit around Earth.
	This region's size is based on the masses of the orbited body and its parent body, and how far away it is from the parent body. For example, the Hill Sphere of Neptune is much larger than the Hill Sphere of Jupiter, because although it is less massive than Jupiter, it is significantly further away from Sol, and so Sol's gravity is much weaker at that distance.
	The Hill Sphere generally lies somewhat within with the L_1 and L_2 points of a body.
	When executing orbital maneuvers, any orbit which extends out further than the Hill Sphere (even if the periapsis lies within the Hill Sphere) is not stable, and thus, you will be unable to maintain such a stationkept orbit. Similarly, you will be unable to excecute orbital maneuvers that interact with the body, such as entering a circular orbit around the body, unless your fleet is within the Hill Sphere.
	Some bodies have a Hill Sphere that is smaller than the size of the body. This means it is impossible to orbit such bodies. Around gas giants, this tends to be true for the inner moons, while the outer moons tend to still have a hill sphere.

Concept Orbital Perturbation	Orbital Perturbation
Concept Orbital Perturbation Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Orbital Perturbation Description
	Orbital Perturbation of an orbit is all the forces other than the gravity experienced from the primary gravitational body. Some examples include celestial body oblateness, radiation pressure, atmospheric drag, and the gravitational force from other nearby celestial bodies.
	Many of these effects are marginal, and can usually be ignored. However, gravitational forces from other celestial bodies can, in some cases, be huge. For example, an object orbiting Io, a moon of Jupiter, will experience a significant gravitational force from Jupiter. This will cause the orbit around Io to not be perfectly circular or elliptical, and in some cases, Jupiter's gravity will cause that orbit to decay. Over time, the object may be pulled completely out of Io's orbit.
	As a result, most spacecrafts perform stationkeeping most of the time, which keeps orbits perfectly circular or elliptical. Starting a trajectory will stop stationkeeping, however, and this is why trajectories may diverge heavily from the original orbital path.
	This divergence can cause many orbital techniques to fail, such as Orbit Phasing or Hohmann Transfers.

Concept Stationkeeping	Stationkeeping
Concept Stationkeeping Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Stationkeeping Description
	Most ships are always performing stationkeeping, which is making tiny thrusts in order to keep their orbit perfectly elliptical or circular. Orbits over time degrade due to orbital perturbation and radiation pressure, but stationkept orbits stay perfectly periodic. As soon as you start a trajectory, your ships stop stationkeeping, so the orbit can decay or change completely over time.
	Orbital perturbation happens because planets and asteroids are not perfectly spherical, which causes the orbits to not behave perfectly elliptically. It also happens because other celestial bodies have their own gravitational pull, which affects everything. For example, a ship in a circular orbit around Luna will experience a significant gravitational pull from Earth, constantly pulling the orbit into a noncircular, unstable pattern.
	Radiation pressure is force applied from solar wind and the photons emitted from the sun, and can also perturb orbits over time.
	A final force that can affect orbits and make them non-elliptical is atmospheric drag; however, this is only relevant for spacecrafts in extremely low orbits around bodies with atmosphere.
	Because these forces can affect orbits and make them lose their perfect elliptical or circular nature, this can actually be a valuable technique to get around. After starting a trajectory, a spacecraft stops stationkeeping, and instead can be pulled around by the gravitational forces, and can sometimes get you where you need to be without expending any delta-v.

Concept Space Rendezvous and Interception	Space Rendezvous and Interception
Concept Space Rendezvous and Interception Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Space Rendezvous and Interception Description
	In order for two ships to meet in orbit, or for two fleets to join up anywhere in space, a space rendezvous must occur. Space rendezvous, like the N-body problem, remains an unsolved problem in physics. All solutions are approximations, since rendezvousing in space while using a minimal amount of delta-v and in the shortest possible time is an optimization problem with 18 degrees of freedom (6 degrees of freedom, plus their first and second derivatives, although in practice, a number of these degrees of freedom can be pruned away).
	As a result, a space rendezvous is not always guaranteed. The rendezvous can fail due to the gravity of the nearest celestial body overwhelming the craft's acceleration, or it can take too much delta-v or time to be feasible. To ensure effective rendezvous, the attempt should start when the positions and velocities are as similar as possible between both fleets.
	Intercepting enemy fleets functions similarly. Something to note is that although retrograde intercepts are possible, the difficulty and the tiny window of time that ships are in range granted by the retrograde intercept makes them generally not useful.
	The best way to guarantee a cheap space rendezvous is to make sure the difference in velocity between the chaser and the target is as low as possible.

Concept Hohmann Transfer	Hohmann Transfer
Concept Hohmann Transfer Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Hohmann Transfer Description
	A Hohmann Transfer is a technique to transfer between two circular orbits around the same body, but of different sizes. An example would be an interlunar transfer between two orbiting moons around a planet.
	To execute a Hohmann Transfer, one only needs to make two separate tangential burns. First, one burn causes the current orbit to become an ellipse until that ellipse osculates the target orbit. Then, when the craft reaches that osculation, the craft must then make another tangential burn to normalize it's ellipse into a circular orbit.
	If a specific position is desired along the target orbit, the Hohmann Transfer does not guarantee that unless Synodic Periods are taken into account. Alternatively, burning additional fuel can overcome this timing restriction.

Concept Synodic Period	Synodic Period
Concept Synodic Period Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Synodic Period Description
	The orbital period of a body is the time it takes for that body to orbit it's parent body. The synodic period between two bodies is the time interval upon which those two objects appear at the same point in relation to each other. For example, if two moons are side by side but one is in a wider orbit, they will move at different speeds. They will no longer be side by side for quite a while, but they will eventually match back up after a period of time. That period of time is the Synodic Period.
	This is of importance for Hohmann Transfers between two bodies around a parent. Such a Hohmann transfer would require a specific time interval to be viable, which means the initial craft has to wait until the correct time presents itself to properly excute the transfer.

Concept Oberth Effect Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Oberth Effect Description
	Burning around a gravity well is most efficient in terms of delta-v when used at the lowest point of that gravity well. For example, given an elliptical orbit around a planet, burning when you are nearest to the planet, at the periapsis, is more efficient than when you are furthest from that planet, at the apoapsis. A circular orbit has no such advantage in this regard. An orbital maneuver which takes advantage of this effect is called a powered flyby, or an Oberth Maneuver.

Concept Orbital Burns	Orbital Burns
Concept Orbital Burns Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Orbital Burns Description
	When orbiting an object, the three most relevant directions to burn in are tangential, radial, and out-of-plane.
	Tangential (red) is perpendicular to the orbited body, but still in the 2D plane of the orbit.
	Radial (green) is still in the 2D orbital plane, but it is directly away from or towards the orbited body.
	Out-of-plane (blue) is directly perpendicular to the orbital plane, and is only useful for making orbital inclination adjustments. If where you want to go is in the same orbital plane as you, there is no need to ever use an out-of-plane burn.

Concept Orbit Phasing	Orbit Phasing
Concept Orbit Phasing Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Orbit Phasing Description
	Orbit Phasing is a technique that allows you to intercept with a target when you share the same orbit as the target but are in a different position along that orbit. Sharing an orbit with a target means you will never catch up to the target, because your orbital periods are identical.
	Contrary to intuition, you can not simply accelerate at your target if they are ahead of you in an orbit, nor can you simply decelerate if they are behind you to reach your target. Accelerating towards your target will widen your orbit, and put you in a higher, slower orbit than your target, while decelerating will tighten your orbit, putting you in a lower, faster orbit. In either case, you will end up even further away from your target. This was discovered early on in spaceflight by NASA in the mid 20th century.
	To actually intercept your target in this way, you can use orbit phasing.
	Orbit phasing involves either accelerating or decelerating in a direction tangential to your current velocity. This will cause your orbit to widen or shrink, both of which reduce your orbital period. Additionally, you will eventually reach the exact same point as when you burned. Timed correctly, you can perfectly intercept any co-orbiting target with a single tangential burn (though if you also want to match velocities at the intercept, you will need a final burn as well).
	The actual result of orbit phasing is opposite what intuition would indicate. To reach a target in front of you, you need to decelerate, since this will bring you closer to the gravitational source, ultimately speeding you up. To reach a target behind you, you need to accelerate, since this will bring you further from the gravitational source, slowing you down.
	Some warnings about Orbit Phasing. If the orbit is elliptical, orbit phasing will not work except at the periapsis (the point closest to the orbital center). Second, if the orbital perturbation is large, orbit phasing may fail or may require additional corrections burns to stay on track.

Concept Gravitational Slingshot Description
	Also known as a Gravity Assist Maneuver, a Gravitational Slingshot is a maneuver where a spacecraft uses a celestial body with a deep gravity well to accelerate or decelerate without using fuel. By exploiting the Oberth Effect deep while within the gravity well, the maneuver becomes a Powered Slingshot, and its efficacy increases greatly.

Concept Long Distance Trajectories	Long Distance Trajectories
Concept Long Distance Trajectories Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Long Distance Trajectories Description
	If you need to alter your trajectory, it is cheapest in terms of delta-v to do so as far away as possible. For example, if you are injecting into a moon's orbit from far away, and you need to change your orbital inclination when you arrive, it's far cheaper to make the required inclination burn long before you ever enter the moon's orbit.
	This is very important for saving delta-v whenever you have a trajectory that involves more than one celestial body, such as transferring between two moons, or going from a celestial body to either of its L_4 or L_5 Lagrange Points.
	In particular, orbital inclination burns are always best done as far away as possible, because the orbital inclination axis don't affect the other two axis of motion.
	One other related note on long distance transfers involving a celestial body, is that injecting into a circular orbit around that body after such a long distance is often the cheapest and simplest way to get captured by that body. After injecting into a circular orbit, the orbit can be easily tweaked and changed as necessary.

Concept Multi-stage Trajectories	Multi-stage Trajectories
Concept Multi-stage Trajectories Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Multi-stage Trajectories Description
	When planning a trajectory that involves more than a single central body, certain considerations must be made.
	Getting to the destination in a single burn or few burns will likely be extremely difficult or impossible. Once multiple bodies are to be considered, multiple burns, at least one per body, are often very necessary. One burn to escape each orbit, and one burn to inject into each orbit. More burns per body may be necessary to correct orbital inclination.
	For example, consider a spacecraft orbiting a moon of Jupiter with a destination of space station orbiting a moon of Saturn. First, a burn must be made to break free of the moon. That puts the spacecraft in an orbit around Jupiter now. A second burn breaks free from Jupiter, putting the craft in orbit around Sol.
	Now a burn must be made to actually get a flyby of Saturn. But this will mean the trajectory will go flying past Saturn, and trying to join with the station will be impossible at those speeds.
	A burn must be made to inject into orbit around Saturn. Then, the trajectory needs to be directed at the moon of Saturn with another burn. Then, a burn to inject into orbit around that moon. Finally, at this point, the problem reduces to a single body problem, with both the spacecraft and the destination space station orbiting the same body. From then on, the problem is solved with standard orbital maneuvers (Hohmann Transfers, Orbit Phasing, Orbital Inclination Changes, etc.).

Concept Generalized Bi-elliptic Maneuver	Generalized Bi-elliptic Maneuver
Concept Generalized Bi-elliptic Maneuver Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Generalized Bi-elliptic Maneuver Description
	A Bi-elliptic Transfer is a maneuver which transfers between two circular orbits, similar to a Hohmann Transfer, though it can often do it at a cheaper delta-v cost. The Generalized Bi-elliptic Maneuver modifies this technique to cheaply accomplish a lot of normally expensive orbital maneuvers, such as switching between retrograde and prograde orbits, or changing orbital inclination.
	Consider a spacecraft in a prograde circular orbit around a planet at 5 km/s. To switch into a retrograde orbit, the spacecraft must spend a total of 10 km/s, 5 km/s to get to a standstill (which would cause the ship to fall straight into the planet), and then another 5 km/s to get into a reverse orbit around the planet.
	To get around this high cost, instead the spacecraft can spend delta-v to widen its orbit into an ellipse. Then, at the apoapsis, or the further point on the elliptical orbit from the planet, the spacecraft can then execute the retrograde burn. The ellipse wraps back around to the initial point, and a final burn is needed to get back into the initial orbit, only retrograde this time. At the apoapsis of this ellipse, the orbital speed is far lower than 5 km/s, and so the ultimate delta-v cost is quite reduced, even when taking into account the initial and final elliptical burns.
	Such a maneuver could reduce the delta-v cost as low as half the originally predicted amount, or better. And as noted before, it is viable for any sort of maneuver that would ordinarily cost too much delta-v when deep in a planet's gravity well, not just prograde to retrograde switches.
	The tradeoff with this maneuver is that it costs much more time to execute otherwise.
	One final benefit of this maneuver, however, is that it doesn't require the high thrusts that ordinarily would come with making such expensive maneuvers.

Concept Low Acceleration Maneuvers	Low Acceleration Maneuvers
Concept Low Acceleration Maneuvers Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Low Acceleration Maneuvers Description
	In many cases, applying burns to a trajectory is instantaneous. The time spent burning is negligible, and the change in the trajectory appears to be instant. However, in certain cases, such as being deep within a gravity well, or using an ion drive, burns are not instantaneous.
	This causes the effects of thrust (and by extension, acceleration) to not be immediately seen, and can prevent certain trajectory changes from being possible. For example, trying to match the velocity of a target when the target is near may be impossible if one's acceleration is too low. In such a case, one must gradually alter the velocity far away from the target in order to gently join up.
	The cyan trajectory turns orange to indicate that a burn is being executed, and thus a very long orange part of the trajectory indicates the burn must be held for a long period, which usually only shows up during low acceleration maneuvers.
	How low is too low? In general, good acceleration for getting around the solar system is 100 mg_0 or greater (mg_0 is milli g_0's; g_0 is Earth's surface gravitational acceleration, 9.8 m/s^2). Closer to planetary gravity wells, or closer to Sol, you will want higher accelerations though.

Concept Exhaust Velocity	Exhaust Velocity
Concept Exhaust Velocity Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Exhaust Velocity Description
	The exhaust velocity of a rocket engine is the speed at which the exhaust leaves the rocket. It is the most important factor for determining the delta-v of a ship (see The Rocket Equation for more info). Thus, exhaust velocity can be thought of as a measure of the quality of a rocket engine.
	Specific Impulse is a term sometimes used to describe this quality, but such a term is obsolete when not dealing with Earth.
	For concrete examples, most combustion rockets used at the beginning of the 21st century have exhaust velocities between 1 km/s and 5 km/s. Nuclear thermal rockets, the primary engine currently in use by all our capital ships, have exhaust velocities between 5 km/s to 10 km/s. Ion drives tend to have exhaust velocities as high as 200 km/s, but are not used due to their abysmal thrust. See Rocket Power for more info.

Concept The Rocket Equation	The Rocket Equation
Concept The Rocket Equation Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept The Rocket Equation Description
	Nearly all of space travel is based on The Rocket Equation (except for reactionless drives, like solar sails). The Rocket Equation demonstrates that the delta-v that a ship has is based on exactly two things: The mass of propellant you expel, and the velocity at which it is exhausted.
	Through The Rocket Equation, a rocket's delta-v is (natural) logarithmically proportional to your mass ratio, and directly proportional to your engine's exhaust velocity.
	As an example, an spacecraft with a mass ratio of approximately 2.7 (Euler's number, e, specifically) will have delta-v exactly equal to the main engine's exhaust velocity. Since the mass ratio's effect is logarithmic, a mass ratio of 7.4 (e^2) will yield twice the delta-v of the engine exhaust velocity, and a mass ratio of 20 (e^3) will yield three times the delta-v of the exhaust velocity.
	For an example, the Space Shuttle, a Earth to LEO (Low Earth Orbit) spacecraft retired in the early 21st century, had a delta-v of approximately 7 km/s, a product of using a two different combustion rockets with exhaust velocities between 2 km/s and 4 km/s with a total effective mass ratio of approximately 16. Another example is the Saturn V, the first Earth to Luna spacecraft from the mid 20th century, had a delta-v of approximately 12 km/s when carrying a full payload to Trans-Lunar Orbit, possible by using combustion rockets with exhaust velocities between 2 and 4 km/s, and a mass ratio of around 23.

Concept Rocket Power	Rocket Power
Concept Rocket Power Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Rocket Power Description
	The power of a rocket is equivalent to the Thrust multiplied by the Exhaust Velocity of that rocket. This demonstrates that for a given amount of power, increasing the exhaust velocity of a drive necessitates reducing the thrust by an equal amount, and vice versa. Thus, engines with excellent exhaust velocity tend to be unusable because the thrust becomes so low that the ship can't even break orbit of asteroids.
	This is why the nuclear thermal rocket, with its comparatively low exhaust velocity (between 5-10 km/s) is used for capital ships as opposed to ion thrusters (with up to 200 km/s exhaust velocities). Despite the wondrous delta-v of ion thrusters, their thrust and acceleration is too weak to be usable for full fledged capital ships executing interplanetary or interlunar maneuvers, lest they take decades to reach their destination. See Rocket Thrust for more information.

Concept Rocket Thrust	Rocket Thrust
Concept Rocket Thrust Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Rocket Thrust Description
	The thrust of a rocket is a very important attribute of a rocket. Although it has no effect on delta-v, it directly determines acceleration. Acceleration of a ship is calculated by the thrust divided by the ship's mass. For example, if an ion thruster generates 100 kN of thrust, and the ship has a mass of 100 tons, then the acceleration of the ship will be 1 m/s^2, or approximately one tenth of a g_0.
	Acceleration of a ship affects three things: what bodies the ship can land and takeoff from, dodging in combat, and most importantly, the rate at which a ship can change its trajectory.
	A ship can only takeoff from a body with a surface gravity less than its acceleration, so in the previous example of the ion thruster, the ship can't takeoff from any planet or from any of the large moons in the solar system, because 1 m/s^2 is too low to do so.
	With a high acceleration, such as when using a nuclear thermal rocket, most changes to a trajectory appear instantaneously. However, with an acceleration lower or close to than the local gravitational acceleration, the trajectory changes slower than the curvature of gravity, yielding unexpected results. Maneuvers such as Hohmann Transfers, or Orbit Phasing, or simply tightening up an orbit are no longer possible, because the ship will change position significantly by the time the burn is finished.
	This is why trajectory plotting is so difficult close the surfaces of high gravity planets: the ship moves significant distance by the time the expected burn has finished, completely throwing off the expected trajectory. See Low Acceleration Maneuvers for more info.

Concept Mass Ratio	Mass Ratio
Concept Mass Ratio Subject	Orbital Mechanics
Concept Mass Ratio Description
	The Mass Ratio of a ship is its wet mass divided by its dry mass. Dry mass is everything except for propellant. Wet mass is everything including propellant. Most ships have mass ratios between 2 and 20, where a mass ratio of 2 means your ship is equal parts propellant and ship, while 20 means your ship is 19 parts propellant and 1 part ship. This is why propellant is almost always the most massive part of building a ship, and usually the most volumetric part as well.
	Mass ratio is very important in The Rocket Equation, as it, along with the exhaust velocity, is one of two attributes that affect the final delta-v of a spacecraft. However, the delta-v is proportional to the logarithm of the mass ratio. This means increasing your mass ratio from 2 to 3 will increase the delta-v significantly, but then the increase from 3 to 4 will increase the delta-v much less, and so on. Most spacecrafts tend to not have a mass ratio in excess of 20 because of the extremely diminishing returns.

Concept Relativistic Effects Description
	The effects of General and Special Relativity have very little influence on the dynamics of the immediate solar system, and on the spacecrafts that travel within it. Special Relativity's effects only become noticable at tremendously high speeds relative to other bodies, at relative speeds close to the speed of light. Thus, spacecrafts within the solar system will never feel any relevant or significant effects.
	General Relativity's effects are only noticable within extremely deep gravity wells, thus the effect is only actually significant very near to the Sun itself, and only Mercury's orbit is close enough to demonstrate significant perturbation due to its effect. Similarly, these effects will never be relevant to spacecrafts traveling within the solar system, and you should never have to worry about Relativity while commanding forces within the solar system.

Concept Asteroid Belts	Asteroid Belts
Concept Asteroid Belts Subject	Astronomy
Concept Asteroid Belts Description
	All asteroid belts, are, contrary to popular belief, extremely sparse. The average distance between asteroids in Sol's asteroid belt is approximately 600,000 km. This means each individual asteroid is so far away from anything else, that going from one asteroid to another is roughly equivalent to going from one planet to another.
	There are no "fields of rocks" in space, as they usually are envisioned, because if the asteroids were that close, they would likely coalesce into a single asteroid. Only around deep gravity wells like planets can ring systems form which are continuous fields of rock and ice.
	An interesting consequence of this is that the asteroid belt can hardly be thought of as a single entity, either politically, or in terms of delta-v "distance", or even in terms of temporal "distance". Although getting from one asteroid to another may be inexpensive in terms of delta-v (via orbit phasing), the time to execute is not feasible for trade, and similarly, using different orbital maneuvers, the time may be quick, but the delta-v cost will be prohibitive for trade, once again.
	For example, plotting a reasonably fast yet inexpensive (delta-v wise) route from one random asteroid to another is often much more difficult than plotting a similar route from one random asteroid to any inner planet, such as Mars.
	There are exceptions, however. Asteroid families are groups of asteroids grouped by an orbital element, like semimajor axis, orbital eccentricity, or orbital inclination. If a family of asteroids all share similar orbital inclinations, you will never have to execute inclination changes when travelling between them, vastly reducing delta-v costs. If a family of asteroids share the same semimajor axis, they share the same orbital period, which means the cost to travel between them is constant, and you never have to wait years and years for them to line up for an ideal transfer to appear.
	As a result, when staging an invasion of an asteroid, or perhaps delivering reinforcements, or trade cargo, other asteroids in that asteroid's family are the cheapest and fastest way to send ships to and from that asteroid.
	The consequences of this are that the asteroid belt can not be considered one monolithic entity, either politically, economically, or culturally. From any single asteroid, over 99% of all other asteroids in the belt are "further" away from that asteroid than the inner planets. Thus, the asteroid belt is very far apart from itself, and only asteroids in the same family can have close trade ties or military ties. Each family of asteroids could develop an consolidated political identity, but between families of asteroids, these asteroid families are about as different and isolated from one another as they are from Mars or Jupiter.

Concept Scale in Space Description
	When including spacecrafts, scale in space spans tens of meters to trillions of kilometers. Zooming in and out of planets, asteroids, and fleets of ships is then necessarily logarithmic.
	In space, it can be very hard to determine distances between objects, or even how large an object is because all frames of references are effectively infinitely far away. Thus, an asteroid may appear the same size as a planet relative to a spacecraft or an orbit, when in fact that asteroid is likely a thousandth of the size of the planet. And in both cases, the spacecrafts relative to either will appear equally small in comparison.

	In case it is not obvious, sound does not travel in space, since there is no atmosphere to carry the sound. Thus, all combat operations, from nuclear detonations to gunfire, are completely silent.
	With that in mind, you can listen to what is happening inside of any allied ships you have selected in combat, from the metal hull groaning under the stress of a nuclear blast vaporizing the outer armor, to the sound of the crew module undergoing explosive decompression when the hull of the module is breached.

Concept Frames of Reference Subject	Astronomy
Concept Frames of Reference Description
	Because everything in the universe is constantly in motion, there is no such thing as an absolute frame of reference. Not the Earth, not the Sun, not the center of the Milky Way, not even the center of the Universe. As a result, one must choose a frame of reference to work within, which usually is the current celestial body that one is orbiting.
	The frame of reference is the origin, the object which is held stationary, unmoving, which all other motion is measured against. Often, whenever escaping a celestial body's gravity well orbit, one should switch the frame of reference to the new orbited body, otherwise the new orbit will not appear as a normal, elliptical orbit.
	For example, if Luna is the frame of reference, it won't move while Earth and Sol will appear to move relative to it, whereas if Earth is the frame of reference, it will be stationary while Luna and Sol move around it. If Earth is the frame of reference and you are looking at Luna, when time passes, Luna will go shooting away.
	Similarly, if a spacecraft around Luna is the frame of reference, the spacecraft will never move, while Luna will appear to orbit the spacecraft. Trajectories can be viewed in this rotating frame of reference, which can be a very valuable tool to match up a trajectory to a target spacecraft, because the target will never move.



Concept Invasion Propellant Staging	Invasion Propellant Staging
Concept Invasion Propellant Staging Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Invasion Propellant Staging Description
	Planning an invasion requires a tremendous amount of delta-v to be expended to get the invasion fleet to the target body. Thus, ships are often equipped with an additional enormous propellant tank, an extra stage, in order to make the journey and enter the target system with full propellant in their internal tanks.
	The external tank is propellant only, rather than a full stage of propellant and engine. This is because nuclear rocket are rather expensive, and so it is cheaper to simply siphon fuel into the spacecrafts' engines rather than have a whole other nuclear rocket.
	The external tank is jettisoned upon injecting into orbit around the target body, as such an attachment would be very cumbersome in combat and provides no benefit whatsover. All invasions start once the external tank is jettisoned and the invasion fleet is fully captured within the target body's gravity well.
	The unpleasant consequences of this method of planning invasions is that no retreat is possible. Once you enter the target body's gravity well, you are locked there, until you win, or until high command decides to send a rescue, which will likely take months. All officers and ship's crew are well aware of this reality, and it encourages them to perform as best as they can, lest they be trapped orbiting an enemy body until they starve to death.

Concept Lasers and Tracers	Lasers and Tracers
Concept Lasers and Tracers Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Lasers and Tracers Description
	Lasers are invisible in space. If you can see a projectile coming at you, it's not a laser, it's likely a mass projectile with a burning tracer on it.
	In atmosphere, pyrotechnic tracers affect the aerodynamics of bullets and reveal firing positions, and so are used sparingly. In space, neither of those things matter, so all bullets are loaded with a burning pyrotechnic composition for confirming and correcting firing accuracy.
	Actual lasers can sometimes be observed as a point of light emanating from the source (since the beam will diffract enough to be visible even to viewers that are not being fired upon), as well as a point of light when it hits its target. Often, the hit location will be ablating a significant amount of liquified or gaseous material as well.

Concept Subsystem Damage	Subsystem Damage
Concept Subsystem Damage Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Subsystem Damage Description
	In combat, every little subsystem you destroy on an enemy ship will have an effect on that ship's effectiveness.
	Targeting no more than one or two subsystems at a time will ensure your weapons fire is focused enough.
	Obviously, targeting the weapons of a ship yields the greatest bang for your buck, but weapons are often small and hard to hit unless you use a laser. On the other hand, if the weapon is a conventional cannon, then damaging it can detonate rounds in the chamber, often leading to a chain reaction ammo explosion, which is one way in which drones can be easily disabled.
	Hitting the radiators of a spacecraft often tends to be the easiest subsystem to target because of their large size, and although radiators can be armored, they usually are not as armored as the rest of the ship. Furthermore, if you can disable the radiators cooling either the main powerplant of a ship, or the crew compartments, you can basically disable a ship entirely. Generally, you can tell which radiators are cooling the main powerplant by the fact that they are glowing.
	Destroying one or more radiators of a drone is often a sure way to reduce the craft's offensive potential. Thus, although a nuclear missile blast might not be able to penetrate a drone's main armor, it might be able to blast off the radiators, which makes them still effective against drones.
	Taking out the engines can immobilize a ship, which is valuable, but it still can shoot back. However, engines tend to be by far the most fragile exposed component of a spacecraft, so destroying them might be a priority. Additionally, there usually is little armor between the engines and the rest of the ship, so attacking from behind the ship is again very valuable.
	Targeting internal modules like crew compartments or propellant tanks would be valuable, but is not possible if the ship has armor concealing its position.

Concept Ship Destruction	Ship Destruction
Concept Ship Destruction Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Ship Destruction Description
	Capital ships become incapacitated when their crew is killed or unable to function. Spaceships can be split in half (or further) and still function normally, as long as each half has a crew compartment to operate the piece. As long as each crew compartment stays pressurized, a split ship is essentially now two ships. Of course, if there are only engines on one of the halves, the other half won't be able to move, and so on. Ships can keep splitting ad infinitum, and any pieces with crew will still be operational and a threat.
	This is one reason why most ships have at least two crew compartments. However, by far the most important reason behind multiple crew compartments is redundancy, in case one compartment is destroyed from a lucky shot.

Concept Nuclear Chain Reactions	Nuclear Chain Reactions
Concept Nuclear Chain Reactions Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Nuclear Chain Reactions Description
	Something to note about missile destruction, is that some missiles, such as high yield nuclear missiles, upon detonating, can cause a chain reaction of nearby nuclear missiles. This has a counter-intuitive consequence due to the way nuclear weapons operate. A nuclear missile that is destroyed without triggering a detonation will not achieve criticality, which means a chain reaction will not actually be useful, and too large of a missile fleet could actually be less effective than a smaller missile fleet, because the first handful of nuclear detonations can disarm subsequent missiles.
	On the other hand, smaller missile fleets may be completely destroyed by enemy anti-missile fire, so trying to find a good balance on the right fleet size is a nontrivial matter.
	One way to get around such a limitation is to launch a large missile fleet, but to have them begin actively homing on their target at different times, as a way to stagger missile fleets.
	Conventional explosives, such as those used by flak missiles, have no such limitation.

Concept Homing and Countermeasures	Homing and Countermeasures
Concept Homing and Countermeasures Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Homing and Countermeasures Description
	There are a multitude of ways to direct missiles to home in on their targets: Laser Targeting, Heat Seeking, Spectral Seeking, Command Guidance, Beam Riding, Passive Radar, Active Radar, Neutron Guidance, Radio Homing, Magnetic Guidance, and Inertial Guidance. However, for every way for a missile to seek, there is a countermeasure: Stealth Materials, Laser Beacons, Smoke, IR Smoke, Flares, Laser IR Jammers, Radar Jamming, Radar Spoofing, Chaff, Neutron Beacons, Degaussed Armor, Radio Beacons, and simple Acceleration (against Inertial Guidance).
	There is clearly a countermeasure for every possible homing device, and likely counter-countermeasures for each as well, and so homing successfully with missiles is a technology game. Since escalation of countermeasures and counter-countermeasures is an expensive game to play, missiles simply settle on a single, simple homing method: Heat Seeking.
	Heat seeking is nearly guaranteed to work since all capital ships emit tremendous amounts of heat through their radiators, and even if they retract them or shut off their powerplants, the thermal inertia keeps them hot for minutes to hours after shutdown. Heat seeking can not be jammed or redirected at the enemy, and it is very reliable and cheap.
	Of course, flares are a simple but costly (in terms of mass) countermeasure that is used by nearly all capital ships. Flares that can put out enough heat to fool homing missiles have to be very fuel heavy, and also need to be expelled at relatively high velocities to get the flare far away from the capital ship. These properties result in them not being effective on the smallest capital ships (because they are so heavy), and on the largest capital ships with lots of radiators (because they can't put out enough heat to conceal the radiators).

Concept Sensors and Stealth	Sensors and Stealth
Concept Sensors and Stealth Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Sensors and Stealth Description
	Sensors to detect and resolve a target are ultimately diffraction limited, which is an absolute physical limit on telescopic resolution based on the sensor diameter, range, and the wavelength of light. For all military applications, sensors on ships are tiny and unnoticeable, and are capable of resolving capital ships into multiple pixels using visible wavelengths at interlunar ranges. Thus, a military commander should never have to worry about what sort of enemy ships she or he is dealing with once in the same planetary system as the enemy fleet. All external modules on a ship will be visible, resolvable, and targetable.
	There is no stealth in space when dealing with reaction drives (like rockets). The energy produced by any viable reaction drives for a capital ship is so enormous that they could easily be visible across the entire solary system. Reactionless drives produce too little thrust to be tactically and militaristically feasible.
	Every faction controls a network of tiny, cheap satellites and statites around the solar system to look for and track the movement of every single spacecraft in the system, which also prevents directional radiating of waste energy.
	From the energy output of every ship watched, the mass, exhaust velocity, thrust, and trajectory of every enemy ship is catalogued and tracked in real time (as fast as light can travel, at least).

Concept Tactical Coasting	Tactical Coasting
Concept Tactical Coasting Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Tactical Coasting Description
	By default, missiles are set to always home on the greatest heat source, and drones are often trying to always aim with a broadside. Both tend to require the engines to always burn, which drains delta-v rather quickly. If either run out of delta-v, they will begin to tumble, which makes them an much easier target to hit and destroy.
	In combats that start very far away, missiles can easily run out of delta-v long before they get near their target, when in fact, the closer they are to their target, the more important it becomes to have thrust to counteract any dodging the enemy might do.
	However, not spending any thrust at first will yield slow missiles that take too long and get shot down. As a result, in combat, missiles spend propellant best at the start, to gain initial velocity towards the target, then should coast for some time, and then should burn the rest of their propellant at the end of their intercept to lock in their target. These three phases are often referred to as the boost, coast, and terminal phases.
	However, one technique the enemy may use to disrupt an incoming missile salvo is to send out a ship to trigger the proximity detonators of the missiles prematurely. As a result, it is valuable to disarm the proximity detonators (much like you would disable any other module) and only re-enable them once they reach the terminal phase.
	Missiles can also use a controlled homing order to save delta-v while still homing on the greatest heat source, but this is not necessarily guaranteed to save enough delta-v for the terminal phase.
	For drones, saving delta-v is often a priority. This is best done by disabling any broadside orders on them, so they coast through space, and to only order them to broadside once they have a clear shot.

Concept High Speed Intercepts	High Speed Intercepts
Concept High Speed Intercepts Subject	Space Warfare
Concept High Speed Intercepts Description
	Intercepting an enemy can easily happen at high speeds in orbits, because orbital velocities are so great, except around small bodies like asteroids. In particular, attempting to intercept an enemy that is retrograde or out of plane will often yield extremely fast relative velocities in combat.
	High speed combat is often undesirable, because unless the two fleets are perfectly matching their intercept, a small error in velocity yields huge, tens to hundreds of kilometers of difference during the intercept. Additionally, even if one does get a perfect intercept, the window of time in which fleets are in range is measured in seconds as the two fleets zoom by each other, which is not very useful.
	With that in mind, when dealing with units which fire weapons at each other like drones and capital ships, combat is best at low speeds. This is best achieved by not making retrograde intercepts or out of plane intercepts. Also, one can avoid high speed combat by taking a large amount of time to gently intercept the target fleet, such as with an orbit phasing maneuver. Finally, manually intercepting by carefully plotting the intercept burns yourself can help avoid a high speed combat, rather than using the auto-intercept from the dropdown.
	On the other hand, missile fleets might actually benefit from high speed intercepts, because it gives a smaller window of time for the enemy to react, providing one can perfectly intercept the enemy. And finally, fast intercepts have the advantage of being harder for the enemy to evade in orbital view, if the enemy is attempting to avoid combat entirely.

Concept Orbital Evasion	Orbital Evasion
Concept Orbital Evasion Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Orbital Evasion Description
	One way to defeat enemy spacecrafts is to simply run them out of delta-v, by making evasion burns when the enemy tries to intercept. The burns are most effective when done far away, instead of right before the enemy tries to enter combat. Also, liberally spending delta-v is another way to make evasion burns more effective.
	Often times, this requires having much more delta-v than the enemy to start with, so it tends to be most useful against drones and missiles. This also makes a good case for keeping a propellant tanker in your combat fleet.
	Evading intercepts is quite easy in orbital mechanics, but the enemy will often recorrect immediately. Additionally, drones and missiles tend to have much greater acceleration, which means that one can not evade them indefinitely, because the enemy will be able to recorrect faster than one can evade. Thus, over time faster spacecrafts will eventually be able to intercept slower evading crafts. Of course, if the slower craft can drain away the faster craft's delta-v quick enough, this should not be a concern.
	Note that this technique is very powerful even if it is not entirely successful. For example, if you can run a drone fleet out of even half their delta-v, that means they will be able to only do approximately half as many flybys against you. Thus, the effectiveness of drones tends to be directly proportional to their delta-v, whereas with capital ships, their delta-v has very little influence on combat. As a result, even if you can't fully evade combat with drones, even making an attempt at it will still very clearly weaken their incoming attack.

Concept Defensive Combat	Defensive Combat
Concept Defensive Combat Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Defensive Combat Description
	For spacecrafts, the primary defense against enemy munitions is armor, monolithic base plates made of high strength alloys or ceramic, possibly with additional thin whipple shields. Beyond that, there are really only three defensive actions available to spacecraft commanders: range, orientation, and decoys.
	If you simply stay out of range, out of combat entirely, you can avoid their attacks. If your ships' weapons can not outrange your enemy's, and you can't weather their barrage, then you have little choice but to avoid combat via evasion, and only attack with missile or drone fleets.
	Orientation can also make a difference against enemy barrages. The cross section that you present to your enemy will affect how much damage you will suffer. A thin cylinder clearly has a smaller cross section head-on than to the side, so it will receive less hits from enemy projectiles when head-on. On the flip side, one may be required to reorient in order to bring a ship's larger cross section to bear in a broadside.
	A final critical point about orientation: armor becomes more effective when sloped (the steeper the slope, the more effective it becomes). For instance, orienting an armor plate at a 45 degree angle will reduce projectile penetration by 30%, and greater slopes will reduce the damage even further. This is why orienting your spacecrafts in combat is crucial, since the angle of your armor against the incoming enemy barrages can significantly increase your survival odds.
	Decoys are the final defensive measure, and these don't just include flares for fooling homing missiles. Spacecrafts, drones, and missiles all produce significant amounts of heat, and if they are close, they can also fool homing missiles. Sending smaller, faster spacecrafts out in front of the fleet can have them draw off not only missiles, but can also have them attract fire from drones and capital ships.

Concept Drones and Missiles	Drones and Missiles
Concept Drones and Missiles Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Drones and Missiles Description
	Warfare in space has analogues to certain kinds of 21st century warfare practiced on old Earth. For instance, spacecrafts are most similar to submarines, thin cylindrical crafts with extremely tight spacing. On the other hand, the extremely high speeds makes space warfare much more similar to air-to-air combat on Earth.
	The greatest analog, however, is to surface-to-surface naval warfare. Spacecrafts are about the same size as large naval crafts, but tend to be much lighter, due to how terrible mass is for your delta-v. As a result, large capital spacecrafts with lots of delta-v make the large burns to get close to the enemy, and then generally launch drones or missiles at the enemy.
	Drones are analogous to fighters launched from aircraft carriers, or, more correctly, to UAVs, a small but fast craft with a gun on the front. Replacing the live pilot with a remote pilot on the capital ship saves on size and mass of drones, which is crucial for delta-v of both the launching ship and for the drones themselves. Trying to replace capital ships with remote controls as well, however, is not viable, because of the speed of light lag that results from trying to pilot them from across the solar system.
	Missiles are similar to anti-ship or anti-tank missiles from old Earth. The difference here is that explosives of all kinds are extremely weak in space, and point defense systems have evolved enough to disarm a single incoming missile. This means that launching clusters of missiles, entire fleets of them, is much more effective than launching them one at a time, as was the original tactic.

Concept Boarding Combat	Boarding Combat
Concept Boarding Combat Subject	Space Warfare
Concept Boarding Combat Description
	Once a spacecraft is disabled, sometimes boarding and capturing the craft is more valuable than destroying it. Laser weapons and high powered projectile weapons would require too great of a power source to be used as a hand weapon. Classic firearms are most useful in space boarding combat. Frangible Rounds, rounds which disintegrate on contact with hard surfaces, are used to preventing ricochets in the very confined space.
	In that vein, concussion grenades are extremely potent in the small, restricted spaces of crew modules. Concussion grenades have a small kill radius and release no shrapnel, causing minimal collateral damage, ideal for spacecraft boarding. Flashbangs are a great nonlethal option for disabling an entire room as well. Of course, the gravity of these crew modules is going to be zero or nearly zero, so grenade throwing mechanics are thrown for a loop. They will still bounce off of walls the same, but there is no longer any arcing of the grenade.
	Boarding spacecrafts and engaging in Close Quarters Combat (CQC) ends up being quite reminiscent of SWAT team assaults, except in zero gravity. Enemies behind cover in every direction, including above and below, in every orientation, not just left and right. Grenades have no arc, and cover can float about untethered by gravity. Cover being able to float around freely and about means the whole battle space behinds highly dynamic, and enemies won't simply be locked to staying in cover. Suppressive fire no longer is as powerful if enemies can still move even when under fire.
	Every soldier will wear a skintight space activity suit, as the bulky air pressurized suits will be too unwieldy for combat, and suffering a suit breach with a mechanically pressurized suit is not nearly as debilitating as in a air pressurized suit. If the soldiers aren't wearing a suit, the enemy could very easily blast a hole in the hull and depressurize the entire crew module, rapidly killing all soldiers without a suit. This leads to an interesting tactical choice, since depressurizing the crew module will heavily reduce the effects of flashbangs and concussion grenades. that scenario would lead to the use of Frangible Grenades as an alternative to having a grenade which would still operate in vacuum and not yield tremendous shrapnel and ricochets.



Concept Ship Layout	Ship Layout
Concept Ship Layout Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Ship Layout Description
	Ships are cylindrically shaped for a variety of reasons. The primary concern when designing a ship is the amount of dry mass. Generally, aside from propellant, a warship's armor has far more mass than all other components. Usually, propellant tanks and radiators come next, and then everything else. With this in mind, to reduce the amount of mass needed for the armor, a convex armor shape is needed. The ideal shape is a sphere.
	However, the tremendous radiation emitted by the nuclear reactors and nuclear thermal rockets call for having crew compartments as far away as possible, even in addition to having radiation shielding. With that, a cylinder is the ideal convex shape, with nuclear reactors and engines at one end, and crew compartments towards the other end.
	Additionally, cylindrical shapes are easier to machine than spherical shapes, and are generally better at saving space, since spheres do not subdivide nicely. In combat, a cylinder can be rolled much more quickly than a sphere, in order to bring guns to bear, or to conceal a damaged broadside. A final advantage of cylinders over spheres is that a cylinder is a much harder target to hit than a sphere, as its cross-sectional area is much smaller than a sphere's, given identical volumes.

Concept Spacecraft Scalability	Spacecraft Scalability
Concept Spacecraft Scalability Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Spacecraft Scalability Description
	Often times when designing spacecrafts, one will come across questions about scaling issues. For example, is a single 100 MW laser better or worse than 100 individual 1 MW lasers? Why do some spacecrafts use many small rocket engines, while other spacecrafts use one very large rocket? Is a swarm of small ships better or worse than one large ship of equivalent mass and firepower? In most cases, the answers are far more complex than one might expect, but a few trends do tend to appear.
	One such trend is that the larger a spacecraft subsystem is, the more efficient it becomes. For instance, the larger you make a laser, the greater the power per volume and power per area. This means, larger systems have a greater distribution of heat and stress throughout the whole system, which allows for much more efficient operation.
	As another example, larger rocket engines actually suffer less stress, as larger thrust chambers distribute the extreme stress of combustion over a larger surface area. The means the chamber walls can be manufactured thinner, and this ultimately is cheaper in terms of mass.
	As a final example, crew modules require a general amount of initial overhead, yet this overhead begins to be reduced the larger and larger you can make these crew modules.
	On the other hand, smaller subsystems allow redundancy, which is extremely important in combat. Ten low efficiency rocket engines is often better than one high efficiency rocket engine when you enter combat, because one rocket can be easily disabled by a stray projectile.
	Most decisions behind this scaling come down to this balance between redundancy and efficiency. However, some other common scaling relationships exist which shouldn't be discounted.
	Volume scales cubically while area scales quadratically, which means the larger the ship you build, the greater the volume to surface area ratio. This means larger ships require less mass for armor proportional to their contents.
	On the other hand, engines are oriented in a flat plane so your thrust scales quadratically, while your volume and mass increase cubically. This means larger ships suffer from lower and lower acceleration the larger they get, even if the number of engines and the thrust of the engines is scaled proportionally.
	A final consideration is that smaller subsystems can be more cheaply produced. Assembly line manufacturing is much cheaper for lots of small systems rather than for few large systems.

Concept Bipropellants	Bipropellants
Concept Bipropellants Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Bipropellants Description
	Many chemical rockets use bipropellants instead of monopropellants. This is because the exhaust velocity of bipropellants are usually better, because you simply can't store the required energy in a single propellant.
	Additionally, if a monopropellant fuel tank is hit, it will explode, whereas if only one of a bipropellant's fuel tanks is hit, the fuel will simply leak out, because it needs the second propellant to actually combust. The obvious downside to bipropellants is that two different fuel tanks are required, as well as the additional complexity of the rocket engine to properly mix the two propellants during combustion.
	When using a bipropellant rocket, the propellant tanks used need to match up with the fuel to oxidizer mass ratio exactly, otherwise some of the mass will be wasted. Note that this is NOT the same as the stoichiometric mixture ratio, and the fuel to oxidizer mass ratio is a derived quantity, indicated in the engine's rocket information. For example, a oxygen and hydrogen bipropellant rocket with a 1:1 stoichiometric mixture ratio has a 4:1 oxidizer to fuel mass ratio, which means you need 4 times as much mass of oxygen as hydrogen to utilize all the propellant on your spacecraft.

Concept Whipple Shields	Whipple Shields
Concept Whipple Shields Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Whipple Shields Description
	A whipple shield (or whipple bumper) is a thin layer of aluminum of other low density armor material placed over monolithic armor plates with significant space between the shield and the main plate. The whipple shield itself tends to be destroyed immediately upon impact, but its destruction shocks incoming hypervelocity projectiles into plasma first.
	The spacing between the whipple shield and the main armor allow the plasma time to expand, increasing the surface area, and thus reducing the pressure of the impacting plasma. This greatly reduces the impact of projectile rounds, however it has the unfortunate downside of being a one-use defense for a small area. Subsequent shots in the same area suffer no ill effects. Additionally, a whipple shield can easily be vaporized by a weak nuclear blast at close range.

Concept Spacecraft Armor	Spacecraft Armor
Concept Spacecraft Armor Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Spacecraft Armor Description
	Spacecraft armor is a convex hull wrapped around the spacecraft's compartments, rather than being form fitting, because convex shapes always have lower surface area than concave shapes.
	Armor on spacecrafts is formed in small, discrete tiles of monolithic plating or simple shielding. Armor integrity is measured by placing sensors all along the inside and the outside of each tile. When the outside sensor is damaged, that tile of armor is marked as damaged. When the inside sensor is damaged, that tile is marked as destroyed.
	Thus, a craft's internal compartments can be damaged or destroyed if only a single tile of armor is destroyed. This is how a spacecraft can be disabled without suffering much damage at all, and this is also why it can be a good idea to reorient your craft in the heat of combat to let your less damaged side begin soaking up damage. Losing an entire spacecraft because a few armor tiles were destroyed is never a good feeling.
	It is not possible to measure "how damaged" a section of armor is without compromising the armor's structural integrity, only if it undamaged, damaged, or destroyed.
	Internal compartments can have armor as well, but it is usually much less than the external plating.
	Armor becomes more effective with how angled it is in comparison to incoming weapons fire. Thus, armor can be made more effective by sloping it, such as with a gradual slope on the nose cone of a spacecraft.
	Finally, one might assume that using materials with extremely high reflectivity, such as silver, would make that material impervious to laser ablation damage. However, upon any sort of damage, the reflectivity of any material drops dramatically, rendering this idea infeasible.
	As a final point, armor is mostly unpainted to reduce mass. Painting the entire shell of a spacecraft can add a significant amount of mass, enough that the delta-v of the spacecraft will be negatively.

Concept Crew Acceleration	Crew Acceleration
Concept Crew Acceleration Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Crew Acceleration Description
	Humans tend to suffer permanent damage at around 9 g's, assuming they have high-g training and suitable high-g crash couches. Crash couches are seats designed to allow the user to undergo extremely high accelerations and survive. Capital ships are not equipped with anything of that sort, since that high of acceleration will likely never be achieved through engine thrust. Achieving even 1 g of acceleration from thrust alone is impressive, given the technologies and masses involved. A more realistic acceleration for capital ships is closer to one tenth of a g.
	Extremely high accelerations will only occur from significant damage, such as from a massive collision that sends the ship spinning like a top. One way to alleviate having your crew get splattered when a capital ship does suffer high accelerations is to keep the crew compartment near the center of mass of the ship, since the centripetal acceleration is proportional to distance to the center of mass.

Concept Cold Welding	Cold Welding
Concept Cold Welding Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Cold Welding Description
	In space, in the absence of an atmosphere, two objects of the same material can be welding together via simple pressure, at low temperatures. This is because in atmosphere, the same two objects will oxidize, developing a thin layer of rust, which prevents cold welding.
	In space, this can be a problem, as objects can fuse together unexpectedly, such as with the breech and the barrel of a conventional cannon. Thus, all objects which come in contact with one another that need to stay apart need to be made out of different materials.

Concept Diffraction	Diffraction
Concept Diffraction Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Diffraction Description
	Diffraction is a fundamental property of light, and has significant consequences for all telescopes and lasers. Whenever light passes through a slit, it radiates its energy apart, weakening severely with distance. Diffraction worsens with longer wavelengths and smaller slit sizes.
	For lasers, diffraction is the most important factor affecting laser range. To counteract diffraction, wide exit apertures and short laser wavelengths are used. This is why frequency doublers are often employed by lasers. Doublers reduce the power of the laser at the expense of a shorter wavelength.
	For telescopes and sensors, this creates an ultimate limit at which a telescope or sensor can detect. After a certain distance, the single pixel resolution of a sensor is fundamentally limited. This is referred to being diffraction limited.

Concept Ammo	Ammo
Concept Ammo Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Ammo Description
	An ammo compartment is a module which supplies ammo to a weapon. Many weapons can have attached ammo bays, and thus do not necessarily need such a compartment, although they still can use them for additional ammo. For carrier modules, which launch large payloads, attached ammo bays often are not viable, and so ammo modules are used.
	Ammo compartments can be much more heavily armored, for example, if explosions are a concern when the ammo compartment is punctured.

Concept Radiator	Radiator
Concept Radiator Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Radiator Description
	Spacecrafts require large heat radiators to eliminate waste heat generated from their powerplants, crew modules, and weapons (although weapons with barrels like railguns, coilguns, and conventional guns use radiative cooling off of their barrel and have no need for radiators). This is because there is no atmosphere, thus no convective cooling is possible.
	Radiators are the long, multi-segment panels that extend perpendicular to the craft, and they generally glow, depending on their inlet coolant temperature. Most engines do not need radiators because they rely on both regenerative cooling (passing the cryogenic propellant through the engine first before expelling it) and radiative cooling from the nozzle.
	All the heat of a spacecraft can't be pumped through a single radiator due to thermodynamics. Heat travels from hot to cold, and every module operates at different temperatures. If two modules, one hot, and one cold, used the same radiator, the cold module would heat up to the temperature of the hot one, and would operate incorrectly, likely melting. Additionally, radiators can't dynamically switching between two systems because of the significant thermal inertia of the radiators, and the extreme temperature ranges required would required abnormally low thermal expansion coefficents for the materials used. Thus, the easiest solution is to have a different set of radiators for each module. Peltier machines could theoretically solve these difficulties, but again, they are expensive, require lots of power, and not worth the effort compared to the simple solution of using many different kinds of radiators.
	Radiators can be easily armored by applying a greater material thickness beyond the coolant pipes' thickness. This negatively affects the heat transfer coefficient of the radiator, and thus the overall efficiency, but it is still much more preferable to having flimsy radiators which get shot off immediately.

Concept Railgun	Railgun
Concept Railgun Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Railgun Description
	A railgun is an electrical projectile weapon which consists of two rails and a sliding armature (or projectile) between them. It can accelerate electrically conductive projectiles to very high velocities compared to conventional cannons.
	The railgun is fired by passing electrical current through one rail, through the armature, and into the second rail. This creates a current loop, and subsequently a magnetic field. This then generates a Lorentz Force which accelerates the projectile along the rails. As long as the armature stays in contact with the rails, the railgun will continue accelerating the armature, although the resistance will increase as the armature gets further along the rails.
	Compared to conventional guns, railguns offer much higher velocities, and do not require explosive ammunition. Conversely, they require tremendous amounts of power that conventional guns do not. Railguns also suffer from problems of excessive ablation of both the rails and the armature, as they slide against each other at extremely high velocities and temperatures.

Concept Coilgun	Coilgun
Concept Coilgun Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Coilgun Description
	Also known as a Gauss Gun, and not to be mistake for a railgun, a coilgun is a magnetic projectile weapon which consists of a series of electrical coils which launch a magnetic projectile through those coils.
	The coilgun is fired by passing current through each coil, or solenoid. This current generates a magnetic field which accelerates any ferromagnetic object inside the coil. Then the magnetic armature is accelerated through one coil, at which point the coil is turned off and the next coil, or stage, is turned on. This happens until the armature has been accelerated through every single stage and exits the weapon.
	Compared to conventional guns, coilguns offer much higher exit velocities, and the ammunition does not have to be explosive. However, coilguns require much more power and expensive magnetic ammunition.
	Additionally, coilguns suffer from magnetic saturation of the ammunition, where the projectile can become overmagnetized, and behaves paramagmetically rather than ferromagnetically. This means that at a certain point, the projectile fails to accelerate. This can generally only be resolved by using larger and larger projectiles.

Concept Laser	Laser
Concept Laser Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Laser Description
	A Laser, an acronym for Light Amplication by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, is a tool for generating a spectrally and spatially coherent beam of light. This means the light is a single wavelength (mostly) and going in a single direction (mostly). This allows it to be focused to a point, inflicting damage.
	The lasers used are arclamp pumped solid state lasers. Solid state lasers are used because they do not require a gas that needs to be expended like ammunition, unlike chemical lasers. They alse do not require supersonic combustion such as in a gas dynamic laser. Finally, solid state lasers use a solid lasing medium, which is simple to use, manufacture, and maintain in space.
	The arclamp is a tube of gas which has electricity pumped through it to generate incoherent light. The light is bounced around an elliptical cavity until it is absorbed by the lasing crystal rod.
	The lasing rod uses stimulated emission to re-amplify the light of a wavelength specific to the material used. Stimulated emission is the process by which a single photon strikes an excited atom, and causes that atom to de-excite, replacing it with two photons of equal wavelength going in the exact same direction. Thus, the arclamp light strikes the lasing crystal, causing it to get excited, and light of the proper wavelength hits the excited crystal atoms, generating more coherent light.
	This process repeats as the light bounces from one end of the lasing crystal to the other, between the mirror at one end and the output coupler at the other, very rapidly building up energy in the form of a continuous packet of spectrally coherent light.
	The output coupler releases the light packet, after which it can pass through further optics, like a frequency doubling crystal, until it reaches the laser exit aperture to be fired at the target.
	Compared to projectile weapons, laser weapons tend to be much more accurate, but require lots of power, and their damage potential falls off very rapidly due to Diffraction.

Concept Conventional Gun	Conventional Gun
Concept Conventional Gun Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Conventional Gun Description
	A conventional gun, or cannon, is a weapon consisting of a (often metal) tube and solid propellant at one end which accelerates a projectile through the tube. It is a cheap projectile launcher and requires effectively no power to fire. On the downside, the ammunition is explosive, and the exit velocities are low compared to most other projectile weapons.
	A cannon works by detonating the explosive propellant. Upon combustion, the explosive material turns into gas, creating immense pressure inside the tube, which propels the projectile down the barrel. The greater the pressure of the explosion, the faster the projectile will be launched, but greater pressure requires stronger barrels, lest the barrel rupture.
	Conventional guns, in addition to having low exit velocities, tend to be extremely inefficient, more so if the propellant is still burning by the time the projectile exits the barrel. Their exit velocities tend to be limited to below 2 km/s.

Concept Carrier	Carrier
Concept Carrier Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Carrier Description
	Carrier bays are electromagnetic accelerators which are made for launching large objects at low speeds, ideal for launching drones, missiles, flares, or anything that does not require aiming. They consist of a linear induction motor which attaches to the payload and accelerates along a fixed magnetic track.
	Carrier bays have the advantage of being mostly internal, allowing only the front armored plate to be visible and targetable by enemies, and they also do not require tremendous electrical power to launch. They also require no additional propellant to launch which makes them better than cannons at launching unaimed payloads.
	In contrast to blast launchers, though carrier bays are more expensive and require power, they can feed internal modules and are not extremely volatile. If a carrier bay is disabled, it generally won't explode unless its ammo bay is hit.

Concept Blast Launcher	Blast Launcher
Concept Blast Launcher Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Blast Launcher Description
	Blast Launchers are similar to carrier bays, but use explosive bolts to launch payloads instead of an electromagnetic launcher. This restricts it to a one-use launching system mounted to the external armor, rather than an internal feed system.
	The primary advantage they serve over carrier bays is no power or radiators are necessary, and they can launch everything with no reload time. This makes them ideal as cheap one-off launchers. On the other hand, they are one-use and can't feed in ammo from an internal bay. Their greatest disadvantage is their volatility. If the armor is penetrated, the launcher's explosive bolts will explode, and this can often be powerful enough to disable the entire spacecraft. This makes extremely thick armor a necessity for this module to be feasible.
	It should also be noted that payloads are launched vertically, which has subtle implications on the cross section of the launched payload. For instance, a laser targeting a vertically launched missile may have a target on the missile body rather than the sloped nose of the missile, making it easier to disable the missile. Of course, this depends on the orientation of the launching ship relative to the enemy ship.

Concept Nuclear Thermal Rocket	Nuclear Thermal Rocket
Concept Nuclear Thermal Rocket Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Nuclear Thermal Rocket Description
	A nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is essentially a nuclear reactor with a rocket nozzle attached to the end of it. The nuclear reactor, which doubles as the combustion chamber, has coolant pumped through it. The reactor heats up the coolant and then expels it through the nozzle.
	This rocket tends to yield much higher exhaust velocities than combustion rockets. This is because the chamber temperature is limited only by the melting points of the reactor materials, and the coolant can have much lower molecular weights than combustion rocket propellants.
	A significant disadvantage of nuclear thermal rockets is that they dump enormous amounts of neutron radiation (both fast and thermal), which need to be dealt with before it hits the crew modules. They also tend to be expensive, as fissiles usually are.
	However, with that in mind, nuclear thermal rockets generate the most rocket power compared to all other rocket engine types. Only combustion rockets come close.
	The high power of nuclear rockets is derived directly from nuclear fission, and the power is completely unfiltered through power generation of any sort. This means that no radiators are needed since all the heat is expelled through exhaust, radiative cooling, or regenerative cooling.
	It has fairly high thrust for capital ships, good for dodging and getting around the solar system. It also has decently high exhaust velocity. This makes it a good drive which is good at everything, but excels at nothing.

Concept Combustion Rocket	Combustion Rocket
Concept Combustion Rocket Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Combustion Rocket Description
	A combustion rocket is one of the simplest kinds of thermal rocket. It involves a monopropellant or bipropellant (tripropellants can be used, but are often not worth the complexity), and these propellants are ignited inside the combustion chamber. The hot gases are then expelled out the nozzle to produce thrust. They become transonic in the rocket's throat, and then supersonic in the nozzle.
	As with any thermal rocket, the temperature is the most important factor determining exhaust velocity, followed by the combusting gases molecular weight. Smaller molecular weights yield faster exhaust. Generally speaking, both of these are governed by the type of combustion reaction used.
	Rocket engines require no radiators to cool as the engine nozzles themselves act as radiators. They can also use regenerative cooling, where the cold propellant is pumped through thin tubes outside the nozzle before being injected into the rocket and ignited.
	Bipropellants have an additional option to vary the stoichiometric mixture ratio of the exhaust. Although a mixture ratio of 1:1 will always yield the highest temperature, a different ratio may yield better results. For example, in a hydrogen-oxygen reaction (LH2 LOX), the hydrogen has a much lower molecular weight. Thus, a ratio which is fuel-rich (greater hydrogen to oxygen ratio) will have a lower average molecular weight of the final exhaust products. Although the temperature will be lower, the molecular weight will be lower as well, which may yield a higher exhaust velocity.
	Alternatively, changing the ratio may require smaller propellant tanks. In the above example, a ratio which is oxygen-rich instead will require more oxygen than hydrogen. Since oxygen is much denser than hydrogen, will require much smaller propellant tanks to operate with. Thus, despite the reduction in exhaust velocity, the final mass ratio of the spacecraft will benefit, which may ultimately yield a better final delta-v for the spacecraft compared to a 1:1 ratio.
	Combustion rockets have the highest thrust of all drives, but the lowest exhaust velocity. It is best suited for drones and missiles, where thrust and acceleration are most important.
	Look into Bipropellants for more information.

Concept Resistojet	Resistojet
Concept Resistojet Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Resistojet Description
	A resistojet is a thermal rocket which uses a simple resistor to heat up the propellant rather than a chemical or nuclear reaction. This makes the design extremely simple, involving a simple resistor coil inside the combustion chamber, in addition to the throat-nozzle system, and the turbopump getting the propellant into the chamber.
	The greatest disadvantage of a resistojet is that it requires an external power supply, something that a nuclear thermal rocket or combustion rocket do not need.
	Generally, to be competetive with the aforementioned rockets, resistojets need a nuclear reactor to power them (doing so is termed a nuclear electric rocket). A nuclear electric powered resistojet is usually much less efficient than a nuclear thermal rocket, because the heat from the nuclear thermal rocket is directly converted to exhaust energy, whereas a nuclear electric rocket gets its power after several stages, with each stage reducing the efficiency along the way.
	However, nuclear powered electric resistojets have a significant advantage over nuclear thermal rockets, and that's temperature. A resistojet's temperature is limited only by the melting point of the coil. A nuclear thermal rocket's chamber temperature is limited by all the elements inside all the nuclear reactor, the fuel elements, the control rods, etc. As temperature is one of the most important factor influencing exhaust velocity, resistojets can have better exhaust velocities than nuclear thermal rockets.
	A final advantage of resistojets over nuclear thermal rockets is that they do not spew neutron radiation everywhere, which makes them very suitable for use as vernier thrusters and retrojets, which are thrusters on the sides and front of a ship used for turning.
	The main disadvantage resistojets have is their power must be electric, likely derived from a nuclear reactor. The drop in efficiency from the nuclear reactor to electric power, and then to the resistojet, is enormous.
	Overall, they tend to have much lower thrust than a comparable nuclear thermal rocket, and slightly higher exhaust velocities.

Concept Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster	Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster
Concept Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Magnetoplasmadynamic Thruster Description
	A magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thruster is a type of ion thruster, one with the highest thrust of all known ion thruster designs. Ion thrusters function very differently from thermal rockets such as the combustion rocket or resistojet. A thermal rocket generates its exhaust velocity by superheating the propellant and then expanding the propellant through a supersonic nozzle. An ion thruster instead uses electrostatic or electromagnetic force to accelerate ions.
	The MPD thruster functions very similarly to a railgun, with one rail being in the center of the drive, the cathode, and the other rail being extruded into a ring around the center, the anode. A gas is pumped via a turbopump into the MPD thruster, and a current is run from the cathode, through the propellant gas, back through the anode. Using the Lorentz force, the same force that propels a railgun armature, the propellant gas (once ionized) is accelerated along the length of the thruster until it is expelled from the thruster.
	Unlike a railgun, a longer thruster length does not necessarily make for a faster exhaust velocity. This is because the gas flow is constant rather than discrete like a railgun, and the arc passes through only the base of the flow, rather than the end. As a result, MPD thrusters tend to be very short.
	The propellant needs to be ionized first to be accelerated, and if the propellant is a molecule (like diatomic H2, hydrogen gas) rather than a single atom (like He, helium gas), the molecule needs to be dissociated (i.e. ripped apart) before it can be ionized. Thus, molecules require much more power and tend to be much less efficient. As a result, monatomic noble gases tend to be the ideal propellant to use.
	MPD thrusters, like all ion thrusters, tend to have extremely high exhaust velocities and very low thrusts. Since these two attributes are inversely correlated for identical power sources ion thrusters tend to be optimized instead for low exhaust velocities to yield high thrusts.
	This generally invalidates the whole reason for using ion thrusters in the first place. As a result, ion thrusters tend not to be useful for any combat ships. The thrust and acceleration is too low to allow dodging in combat. Also, it takes an extremely long time to get anywhere with accelerations that low.

Concept Propellant Tank	Propellant Tank
Concept Propellant Tank Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Propellant Tank Description
	Propellant tanks are often one of the most important aspects of spacecraft, and often the most overlooked part of them. Except for armor, the propellant tank shell is often the most massive part of any spacecraft, which means the propellant tank shell is one of the primary things that yields a lower mass ratio, and thus, a lower delta-v. In fact, the propellant tank shell mass divided by the propellant mass inside the tank yields the ultimate mass ratio that a ship can achieve, asymptotically approaching this mass ratio but never exceeding it. This means the propellant tank itself yields an ultimate limit to the actual delta-v that any spacecraft can have. In any ship without armor, such as in a tanker, this limit appears very quickly, as it becomes apparent that adding on more and more propellant tanks yields little to no gain in mass ratio.
	A second consideration for propellant tanks is the propellant density itself. A high density propellant is very small, and is ideal, whereas a low density propellant causes the ship to balloon in size, yielding larger propellant tanks, and thus a larger and heavier armor shell, and finally, makes the ship a much bigger target for enemies to hit. This is the primary disadvantage to hydrogen propellant in nuclear thermal rockets. Although it beats out every other propellant in terms of exhaust velocity, its extremely low density yields ships which need to be many times bigger than when using any other propellant. Generally, propellant exhaust velocity in a nuclear thermal rocket is inversely proportional to density, which means there is no propellant which ideally maximizes both properties.
	Propellant tanks are slightly pressurized, and use a series of screens that, through the force of surface tension, allow the propellant to exit the tank and be used in their entirity in zero gravity. This removes the need for a ullage thrusters or any pressurized diaphragm for getting all the propellant out.
	Propellants, especially hydrogen, experience a slight amount of boiloff, and leakage, from the tank over time, but this is accounted for in any long term trip, and you do not need to design around that consideration.

Concept Crew	Crew
Concept Crew Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Crew Description
	A crew is necessary for a spacecraft to be controlled and receive orders. Without a crew module, and with only a remote control, the spacecraft is essentially a drone, and is not feasible to use for long term journeys through space. Thus, the key thing that delineates capital ships from other crafts is a crew, and only capital ships may be used to start a mission. All drones must be launched from capital ships once a mission has started.
	The crew uses a water recirculation system for sewage and water supply both. However, food and oxygen are both stored for the duration of the mission, which is generally taken to be 6 months long. Obviously some missions take longer, and some are much shorter, but under 6 months works out as a reasonable average for a crew to go without docking at a space station.
	The air used is 22% oxygen, and the rest is mostly nitrogen, in order to maintain one atmosphere of pressure, and, more importantly, to prevent fires from becoming as deadly as they are in a pure-oxygen environment. Crew members operate without a space suit inside the crew module, and so the crew module is often lost when the hull of the module is breached.
	Crew modules generate a small amount of heat from the lighting system, the galley cooking system, and the heat emitted by each crew member, which needs to be dissipated through the radiators at a very low temperature. This low temperature often requires much larger radiators than what would be expected for such a small amount of heat.
	Spacecraft crews are run as skeleton crews always. Crew compartments, when food and air is accounted for, are quite massive and volumous. As a result, crews are generally kept extremely small even for the largest capital ships. Each crew is tiny compared to an 21st century earth-based naval ship of comparable size, a small group of highly trained individuals who often can perform multiple jobs in the case of crew member death.
	Modern spacecraft crews are very similar in nature to nuclear submarine crews of old earth, with space being a premium, and the crew complement living in extremely cramped quarters, just big enough to do their jobs in, with enlisted men and women hotbunking to further save space on living quarters.
	Crew members live 18 hour days, with 6 hours on watch, and twelve hours off watch generally. Between the three watches, meals are served for the entire crew. When a spacecraft enters battle or a port, all crew members man their stations.

Concept Remote Control	Remote Control
Concept Remote Control Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Remote Control Description
	A remote control is necessary for any drone or missile to be able to give that spacecraft orders once it is in flight. It also includes the sensor suite necessary for that spacecraft to be able to home in on heat signatures, as missiles generally do. All power needed is generated by a small internal battery, and thus, no external power source is needed, which is why missiles generally don't need power generators to function.
	For details on how homing behaviors are controlled by the remote control, see the article on Missile Guidance.

Concept Fuse	Fuse

Concept Fuse Description
	A fuse is the simplest command module, which simply fires all engines after a time limit, as well as optionally detonates all payloads after a time limit. It does not perform any sensing, guidance, or navigation.

Concept Missile Guidance	Missile Guidance
Concept Missile Guidance Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Missile Guidance Description
	Guiding a missile is a complex problem with no ideal solution. Homing behaviors controllable by a remote control are as follows.
	Unguided - The missile will not thrust.
	Pure Pursuit - The missile will try to go straight for the target.
	Deviated Pursuit - The target's future position is estimated, and the missile will go straight for the future position. Basic leading of the target.
	Proportional Navigation - The missile will burn to reduce the perpendicular motion relative to the target.
	Augmented Proportional Navigation - This does Proportional Navigation, but will also try to anticipate enemy dodging.
	If you have infinite delta-v and perfect thrusting without rotation, these algorithms will work fine. However, you do not have delta-v, so guidance is split into three phases.
	Boost Phase - An initial burn to accelerate the missile to reasonable speeds. Also, guidance corrections made need to be done if the enemy is flying highly perpendicular to your missile.
	Midcourse Phase - A state where the missile coasts towards the target to save delta-v. Potentially, guidance corrections may need to be made in this phase. Of course, if too many corrections are made, delta-v may be used up, and the missile will fail. The primary reason missiles lose their delta-v before contact is because they made too many corrections during the midcourse phase. On the other hand, against enemy missiles, the midcourse phase is the best time to try to dodge.
	Terminal Phase - Once the missile determines it has enough delta-v to burn all the way to the target, it enters terminal phase, and usually uses all of its delta-v up.
	Also, you will rarely have perfect thrusting without rotation. Gimballed engines, for instance, require the missile to rotate to work. This can render all these algorithms useless, (Augmented) Proportional Navigation especially. Thus, damping of each stage is used to prevent the missile from fully implementing the algorithm.

Concept Cargo Bay Description
	Cargo are goods and miscellaneous material that needs to be transported across the solar system, anything from electronics, to ore, to nuclear waste, to food, to frozen air, water, methane, hydrogen, and so on. They have no specific combat value other than being sometimes explicitly necessary to objectives.

Concept Radiation Shield	Radiation Shield
Concept Radiation Shield Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Radiation Shield Description
	A radiation shield is a simple piece of flat material designed to protect human beings from radiation damage, generally from the nuclear reactors or nuclear thermal rockets. It protects against both fast and thermal neutron radiation from nuclear reactors, as well as gamma radiation from radioisotope generators and solar storms.
	Gamma radiation protection is often easily done, generally with a material which is optically opaque at gamma wavelengths. Neutron radiation protection, on the other hand, is much more difficult, especially since nuclear reactors generate an absurd amount of fast and thermal neutron radiation. Neutron radiation is attenuated by elements with high neutron absorption cross sections. Anything that can scatter neutrons elastically or inelastically, or interact with fast or thermal neutrons in any way will protect against the radiation.
	The other effective way to attenuate radiation is through distance. This is one reason for the cylindrical shape of spacecrafts: it allows all radiation production systems, such as reactors and nuclear engines, to be placed at one end, and the crew modules at the other end of the spacecraft. Most spacecrafts use a combination of distance and radiation shields.
	Since a radiation shield is little more than a flat plate of material, it can be used as an armor plate as well.

Concept Refueler	Refueler
Concept Refueler Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Refueler Description
	A refueler is a simple turbopump with a hose attached that can reach to other spacecrafts in the nearby vicinity. The process is similar to atmospheric refueling, but in space, the process involves no air resistance, and thus all maneuvering of the boom to the refueling craft can be solved with a nondeterministic solver. The hose generally should be a material with a very low Young's Modulus, and can withstand the cryogenic temperatures of the propellant being transferred, as well as having very low leakage of the propellant.

Concept Flare	Flare
Concept Flare Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Flare Description
	A flare is a pyrotechnic composition designed to generate a tremendous amount of heat as a countermeausere. If a flare can generate more heat than a ship's radiators, heat seeking missiles will be attracted to the flare instead of the ship's radiators.
	The pyrotechnic composition is a delay composition, or some material which slows down the combustion reaction, combined with an actual explosive material. A slower reaction allows the flare to burn for a longer amount of time, but a slower burn rate means the flare will generate less heat, which is a tough balance to strike.
	Generally, spacecrafts with nuclear reactors put out a tremendous amount of heat, which means each flare must be extremely large (compared to flares used by 21st century terrestrial aircraft), and so launching such flares at high speeds is a challenge in of itself. A slow moving flare is often rather ineffective, because a nuclear missile that chases such a flare will often detonate with a significant area of effect, and a slow moving flare will likely have not moved far enough away from its parent spacecraft to get its parent spacecraft out of the area of effect.

Concept Explosive	Explosive
Concept Explosive Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Explosive Description
	An explosive module is a composition of combustable materials which will detonate with a proximity fuse, causing high temperature gas to expand rapidly. In atmosphere, explosives are much more effective due to the shockwave that forms when the expanding gases collide with the atmospheric gases. In space, however, the explosive gas simply expands omnidirectionally without resistance, quickly losing temperature and ineffectually bombarding anything nearby with a thin coating of cooling gas, inflicting very little damage.
	As a result, in space, explosive modules usually has a layer of material on the outside of the module, to generate a cloud of shrapnel when it detonates. The explosive is formed in a cylinder with the shrapnel material wrapped around the cylinder, rather than a sphere, because the shrapnel will expand in two dimensions rather than three. This means as the shrapnel expands, the hit probability reduces by a factor of a square rather than a cube. Additionally, an explosive payload detonating in a sphere would have some of the shrapnel detonate backwards, thus slowing down, becoming less effective at inflicting damage (although some would detonate forwards, increasing damage), whereas a cylindrically detonating explosive will not affect the detonating shrapnel's forward velocity in any way.

Concept Nuclear Payload	Nuclear Ordnance
Concept Nuclear Payload Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Nuclear Payload Description
	A nuclear ordnance is a device which detonates, triggering nuclear fission within its fissile core. The fission generates a tremendous amount of heat energy, which yields an enormous amount of high energy photons. The types of nuclear ordnance used by our space forces are implosion fission devices and boosted implosion fission devices. Gun type fission devices and thermonuclear devices are not used by our space force.
	The implosion fission design involves a core of fissile material (potentially hollow to prevent it going supercritical when it's assembled) surrounded by high explosives. The high explosives are oriented in an explosive lens to properly collapse the fissile core in a uniform manner within nanoseconds. This increase of density of the core causes the core to exceed a critical density, which causes the device to undergo nuclear fission. The device can be boosted with a fusile core, where fusiles are inserted into the hollowed out core. These fusiles undergo fusion, but it's generally not significant enough compared to the fission, thus the device is still considered a fission weapon rather than a fusion weapon. The fusiles, while undergoing fusion, release significant amounts of neutrons which make the initial fission reaction much more efficient than a simple implosion device.
	Nuclear weapons are a lot less effective in space than in atmosphere. In atmosphere, the high energy photons are immediately absorbed by the air, and manifest as an intense fireball and shockwave.
	In space, there is no atmosphere, so a nuclear explosion becomes nothing more than a powerful flash bulb. The photons simply flash againt the target and inflict damage by melting and vaporizing the armor. Although tremendously inefficient in space, nuclear weapons, especially boosted fission weapons, tend to compensate for that simply in terms of raw energy.

Concept Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator	Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator
Concept Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Description
	A Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) is a way to generate a small amount of power not through fission, but through radioactive decay. A radioactive fuel pellet is attached to a thermocouple, which converts a heat gradient into electrical power, and then at the exit of the thermcouple, coolant flows past, which carries the heat away to the radiators. The efficiency is derived completely from the thermocouple's efficiency, which is derived from the P and N type thermocouple material's thermoelectric sensitivity differences, and the total temperature delta across the thermocouple.
	If the radioactive material generates gamma radiation, that radiation needs to be stopped before it can reach any crew compartment, although alpha and beta radiation can be stopped without concern.
	Generally, the more energy the radioactive material generates, the faster it will decay, which requires more material to be used to provide an expected amount of power over a long journey through space. This kind of generator is popular for drones which do not require large amounts of power, as it is extremely small compared to most nuclear reactors.

Concept Thermoelectric Fission Reactor	Thermoelectric Fission Reactor
Concept Thermoelectric Fission Reactor Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Thermoelectric Fission Reactor Description
	A thermoelectric fission reactor is a nuclear reactor which generates heat through fission, and derives power from that heat through a thermocouple. The heated coolant is passed along on side of the thermocouple, and the coolant on the other side of the thermocouple draws the heat away to the radiators. The efficiency of the device relies on the thermocouple's efficiency, which depends on the P and N type materials, as well as the temperature delta across the thermocouple.
	As with any nuclear reactor, there is basically no practical upward limit to the amount of heat that a nuclear reactor can generate, and a reactor with a short lifetime can have that lifetime easily extended by simply adding a little more nuclear fuel. Generally, the heat a reactor can generate is limited by the melting points of all of the materials within the reactor core. For more information, look into Nuclear Reactors.

Concept Turboelectric Fission Reactor	Turboelectric Fission Reactor
Concept Turboelectric Fission Reactor Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Turboelectric Fission Reactor Description
	A turboelectric fission reactor is a nuclear reactor which generates heat through fission, and derives power from that heat through a turbine (via the Closed Brayton Cycle). The heated coolant is passed through the turbine, then through the radiators to cool down, and then back through the turbopump to be pumped back into the reactor core. No separate coolant loop with a heat exchanger is used, as that is inefficient, and if the coolant loop is broken, leaking radioactive coolant into space is hardly a concern (compared to being a serious problem if such a system were to leak in an atmosphere).
	The efficiency of the system comes down entirely to the turbine's efficiency, and how easily it can extract energy from the coolant. Unlike thermocouples, it does in fact convert heat into energy (rather than converting a heat gradient into energy), although it is only so efficient, meaning it still requires lots of heat radiators all the same to keep operating. For more information, look into Nuclear Reactors.

Concept Material Properties : Mechanical Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Material Properties : Mechanical Description
	Yield Strength: Also known as the Offset Strength, this property is the total amount of stress that a material can withstand and still elastically return to its original shape. Stress applied on a material beyond this point will cause the material to permanently deform, while stress before this point will deform the material only as long as the stress is continuous applied. This property is extremely important, as it determines the maximum amount of stress many modules and systems can undergo before they become useless. For example, a gun barrel that permanently deforms under the stress of firing becomes unusable, but if the deformation disappears once the firing stress stops, the barrel remains usable and can fire again. Thus, for gun barrel stress, the Yield Strength is the most important mechanical property. The Yield Strength has applications everywhere in spacecraft design.
	Ultimate Tensile Strength: Also known as the Tensile Strength or the Ultimate Strength, is the total amount of stress a material can withstand before it fractures, or shatters. This is also a very important property of any material, and always equals or exceeds the Yield Strength, meaning materials initially deform reversibly under stress, then at higher stresses deform permanently, and then at even higher stresses, crack. For example, armor can elastically deform under kinetic stress and still be viable (at reduced effectiveness). On the other hand, once the stress exceeds the Ultimate Tensile Stress, the material cracks, and becomes useless as armor. Many ceramics have an equal Yield Strength and Ultimate Tensile Stress, meaning the material does not undergo permanent deformation, and instead immediately shatters at that stress point.
	Young's Modulus: Also known as the elastic modulus, or tensile modulus, the Young's Modulus is a measure of stiffness of a material, or how resistant the material is to deformation. It has nothing to do with the strength of a material, as strength deals with the amount of stress the material can withstand before it's behavior changes, while Young's Modulus is a measure of *what* happens to the material when stress is applied. A material with a high Young's Modulus (like Diamond) will deform minimally when stress is applied, while a material with a low Young's Modulus (like Rubber) will deform significantly under the same amount of stress. One application of Young's Modulus is thermal expansion stress. When a material undergoes a temperature delta, it expands or contracts, causing mechanical stresses throughout the material. A material with a low Young's Modulus, thus a low stiffness (high elasticity), will suffer less stress because it can more easily expand or contract. This has significant applications in rocket engines, railguns, and nuclear reactor thermocouples, where high temperature differences are found.
	Shear Modulus: Also known as the modulus of rigidity, the Shear Modulus is identical to Young's Modulus except it measures the material response to shear stress rather than uniaxial stress. Thus, it is a measure of rigidity of a material, or the materials ability to withstand shearing, or stress parallel to the material cross section. One application of the Shear Modulus is the shearing that occurs at fluid boundary layers between a fluid and a solid, such as in a coolant pipe, or in a rocket engine.
	Bulk Modulus: This property is identical to the Young's Modulus, except it measures response uniform pressure on a material. Thus, it is a measure of resistance to compression. It is most important in fluid dynamics again, as it measures how much a fluidic material will compress based on the pressure on the fluid. It is important whenever fluid is involved, such as with any coolant systems, nuclear turbines, or rocket engines.
	Poisson's Ratio: This property is the measure of how the material deforms axially versus transversely. For example, when a material is stretched in one direction, it may squeeze in the perpendicular directions, and vice versa. The degree of deformation is measured by the Poisson's Ratio, and it occurs in the fluid dynamics of pressurized coolant pipes.

	Melting Point: This is the temperature at which the material turns from a liquid to a solid or vice versa at ambient space temperature and pressure. Many materials do not have a set melting point, and instead have a decomposition temperature, which is the temperature at which the material breaks apart (but not necessarily melts). In either case, this is the temperature that the material no longer is viable for being structural. This property is of crucial importance to armor against laser damage, and against everything that requires high temperature, such as nuclear reactors, rocket engines, and heat radiators.
	Boiling Point: This is the temperature at which the material turns from liquid to gas or vice versa at ambient space temperature and pressure. Most materials do not have a set boiling point at all, as most decompose long before then. The boiling point is important for any fluid dynamics systems, such as coolant systems, or turbines, but for most parts of a spacecraft (which are nearly all solid), this property is not used.
	Specific Heat: The specific heat capacity at constant pressure is a measure of how much energy is actually stored within a material per degree Kelvin of temperature and kilogram of mass. Thus, for two objects made of different materials but with the same temperature and the same mass, the Specific Heat measures how many Joules of energy each object actually has. A high specific heat capacity material can absorb tremendous amounts of energy and yield only minor temperature increases, while a low specific heat capacity material will become extremely hot with only minor increases of energy. This property is of critical importance in many different applications. For example, materials with a very high specific heat capacity can soak much more laser energy before it suffers damage. Objects that need to stay cool in the face of high energies, such as those in a rocket engine, similarly need a high heat capacity. On the other hand, heat radiators become much more effective at high temperatures, so materials with a very low specific heat capacity can become much more efficient at much lower masses.
	Thermal Conductivity: This important property measures how fast heat transfers across this material. A material with a high thermal conductivity conducts heat quickly, and heats up or cools down quickly based on the environment it's in. A material with a low thermal conductivity on the other hand, can retain its original temperature much longer regardless of the environment it's in. High thermal conductivity is very important for heat radiators, thermocouples, and any coolant materials. Low thermal conductivity is very important for insulator materials, such as those keeping in high temperatures found in rocket engines and nuclear reactors. It also is valuable for preventing laser damage from "bleeding" across armor.
	Thermal Expansion Coefficient: This coefficient is a measure of how much a material expands or contracts with temperature increases or decreases. A high thermal expansion coefficient means a material with expand greatly with minimal temperature increases, and contract greatly with minimal temperature drops. A low thermal expansion coefficient is very resistant to size changes, and requires much greater temperature jumps or drops to change significantly. A negative thermal expansion coefficent means the material contracts at higher temperatures, and expands at low temperatures, and is a very rare property. In most applications, a low thermal expansion coefficient is desired, as significant expansion causes significant thermal expansion stress. It is found anywhere on a spacecraft that temperature increases or decreases happen, from weapons fire, to rocket engine exhaust, to coolant pipes, to heat radiators, to powerplant thermocouples, to nuclear reactor cores, to laser heating damage.

Concept Material Properties : Electrical Description
	Resistivity: This is a measure of how well the material resists electrical current. A very low value is desired for electrical conductors, such as those found in railguns, coilguns, and magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters, while a very high value is desired for electrical insulators, such as those found in those same systems, but for different elements of those systems.
	Conductivity: This is simply the inverse of the resistivity of a material. High conductivity yields a good electrical conductor, and low conductivity yields a good electrical insulator.
	Dielectric Strength: The dielectric strength, or breakdown voltage, of a material is the maximum voltage the material can withstand before it experience failure in the form of an electrical discharge. This value is primarily used when designing capacitors, which need to withstand very high voltages to provide with high capacitance.
	Thermomelectric Sensitivity: Also known as the Seebeck Coefficient, this property measures how much voltage the material produces based on the temperature difference across that material. It is how thermocouples work; as heat travels across a pair of materials with inverse thermolectric sensitivities, a voltage is generated based on the difference between the sensitivities, which is used to generate electrical power. It is of critical importance for all powerplants which use thermocouples to generate power.
	Relative Permittivity: Also known as the Dielectric Constant, it is a measure of the material's permittivity relative to vacuum. The permittivity of a material is the resistance the material experiences forming an electric field. It is most important for building capacitors.

Concept Material Properties : Magnetic Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Material Properties : Magnetic Description
	Relative Permeability: Not to be confused with Relative Permittivity (which is an electrical property), this is the material's Permeability relative to vacuum. The permeability of a material is the measure of how easily it forms a magnetic field. It is the primary factor involving how powerful of a magnetic field you can get from a material, and is the most important property for coilgun projectiles and linear induction motor stators.
	Magnetic Susceptibility: The magnetic susceptibility of a material is closely related to the relative permeability, and measures how magnetized the material becomes in response to an applied magnetic field.
	Remanence: The remanence of a material is how much of a magnetization remains in a material when the external magnetic field is removed. It is used by linear induction motors, and any magnetic systems which do not actively generate a magnetic field.
	Saturation Magnetization: All materials, in the presence of a strong enough applied magnetic field, saturate, meaning their magnetic field can not be increased any further. This has significant consequences for coilguns, as saturated magnetic projectiles can not experience any greater acceleration.
	Magnetic Saturation Flux Density: The saturation flux density is a measure of the total magnetic field that is allowed from the saturation magnetization.

Concept Material Properties : Optical Description
	Refractive Index: The refractive index and extinction coefficient of a material are dimensionless quantities which describes how light propagate through that material. They are most useful for determining how reflective the material is, how transmissive the material is, and how absorptive the material is, which is directly equal to how emissive the material is as well. The reflectance and transmittance of materials are very important in laser cavities, for example. Mirrors need high reflectivity while lens need high transmissivity. Radiators, or at least radiator finishes, should have high emissivity for the wavelengths that they radiate primarily on. High reflectivity is created by having a large difference between refractive index and extinction coefficient, while simultaneously having a low value in each. High absorptivity is created solely through having a high extinction coefficient. High transmittivity is created by having both a low absorptivity and a low reflectivity.
	Emission Spectra: The emission spectra of a material is the wavelengths of light that are generated when the individual particles are excited, such as in a plasma, an electrical arc, or in a rocket exhaust plume. It is primarily used in laser arclamps, as it is the initial wavelengths that will initially pump an arclamp pumped laser. When choosing an excitation medium, one should try to line up emission spectra peaks up as closely as possible to the lasing medium pumping bands.
	Optical Lasing Damage Threshold: This measures how much photon power this material can withstand passing through it before suffering irreversible damage. It is of critical important to all optical materials in lasers, from lens, to mirrors, to any transparent media within.
	Nonlinearity Coefficient: This value is a measure of how well the material behaves as a nonlinear optic, specifically affecting the optic's nonlinear drive. Nonlinear optics are important because they allow frequency switching of lasers, allowing much high frequency (and thus lower wavelength) of lasers.
	External Angular Sensitivity: This value is also important only for nonlinear optics, as it measures affects the dephasing factor of a nonlinear optic crystal, and ultimately the overall efficiency when frequency switching lasers.
	Transition Wavelength: This is a property that only lasing media have, and it is the wavelength at which that material generates photons for stimulated emission and subsequent lasing. It is the wavelength at which photons will be emitted from the laser if the laser is not frequency switched.
	Pumping Bands: Also a lasing media property, these are the wavelengths at which the material can be pumped with photons to excite them, readying them for emission. The bands, when pumped with an arc lamp, should line up with the peaks of emission that the arc lamp excitation spectra for maximum efficiency.
	Transition Cross Section: This measures a lasing medium's atomic cross section for transitioning between energy levels. The transition between energy levels is what governs emission as well as absorption of photons.
	Spontaneous Lifetime: The spontaneous lifetime is how long a number of atoms will stay excited before a proportion of them decay, similar to radioactive half lives.
	Atomic Lasing Density: The atomic lasing density measures how many atoms exist per unit volume which can undergo absorption and emission in the lasing medium.

Concept Units	Units
Concept Units Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Units Description
	The units in use are all primarily SI units.
	The SI prefixes commonly used are as follows: T (10^12, Tera), G (10^9, Giga), M (10^6, Mega), k (10^3, Kilo), m (10^-3, Milli), µ (10^-6, Micro), n (10^-9, Nano), p (10^-12, Pico). For example, a TW is a Terawatt, or 10^12 Watts, or 1 trillion Watts. 
	Meter (m) - Measure of distance, length, commonly seen as meters (m), centimeters (cm), and kilometers (km). AU are Astronomical Units, which are also used for very large distances.
	Second (s) - Measure of time. Meters per second is velocity, and meters per second squared is acceleration.
	Kilogram (kg) - Measure of mass. Technically, the gram (g) is the base unit, but kilogram is used as the default in terms of other units. The ton (t) is 1000 kilograms (and the kiloton, kt), and is commonly used for ship mass.
	Newton (N) - Measure of force, equal to a kilogram meter per second squared.
	Pascal (Pa) - Unit of pressure and stress, common in mechanical systems, equal to a Newton per meter squared. For example, material Yield Strength is often measured in Megapascals, MPa.
	Kelvin (K) - Unit of temperature, but not a measure of heat energy, since each material has a different temperature for the same amount of energy.
	Joule (J) - Unit of energy, equivalent to a Newton meter. Used in many places, such as a rough measure weaponry destructive ability, or heat energy in a system, since Kelvins are material dependent.
	Watt (W) - Unit of power, equal to a Joule per second, or energy measured over time. It is the unit which powerplants are based off of, and which spacecraft systems use. Another unit you may also say is We and Wt, which stands for Watt electric, and Watt thermal respectively. These are identical to Watts, but the subscript simply indicates what the power is used for or where it comes from.
	Ohm (Ohm) - Unit of electrical resistance, measuring how much the material or system resists electrical conduction. The inverse of it is the Siemen (S).
	Moles (mol) are a measure of the amount of a substance, an actual physical count of the number of atoms, or molecules of something. It is commonly used in chemical reactions.
	Sievert (Sv) - Unit of health effect of ionizing radiation on human beings. It is equal to effective Joules per kilogram, or the biological effect of energy absorbed per unit mass of human tissue. It is not equivalent to the Gray (Gy), which is the exact energy per unit mass. Different kinds of radiation have different effects on human biology, so the Sievert takes into account these differences in its units, which the Gray does not.
	Other Units - Ampere (A), Volt (V), Coulomb (C) are measures of electrical current, electrical potential, and electrical charge respectively. Barns (b) are measures of extremely tiny surface areas, used in atomic cross sections. Electron-Volts (eV) are units of energy, like Joules, equal to a Joule multiplied by the elementary charge. Many atomic and subatomic applications make more sense to speak of in terms of electron volts than Joules because of how small the energy scales are.

Concept Nuclear Reactors	Nuclear Reactors
Concept Nuclear Reactors Subject	Spacecraft Engineering
Concept Nuclear Reactors Description
	A nuclear reactor generates heat by way of nuclear fission, and the heated coolant is used to generate electricity in a powerplant, or the coolant is used as exhaust in a rocket engine.
	Nuclear fission is the process by which an atom splits into two different atoms, and is generally initiated by striking a fissile atom with a neutron (usually a thermal neutron, or a neutron moving at newtonian speeds, although fast neutrons, or neutron traveling near the speed of the light, can be used too, with reduced efficiency). When a fissile atom, such as Uranium-235 undergoes fission, it emits a number of fast neutrons and those neutrons strike nearby fissile atoms, causing a chain reaction, and the fission reaction becomes not only self-sustaining, but also self-escalating, increasing in power until stopped. This is the principle by which a nuclear device detonates, and it is the principle by which a nuclear reactor starts up. Once a reasonable level of power is sustained in a nuclear reactor, however, the reaction is stifled through various means in order to maintain a constant power output.
	In a nuclear reactor, unless it is a fast reactor, a neutron moderator is needed, in order to cause the fast neutrons to slow down to thermal speeds, becoming thermal neutrons, which allows them to trigger more fissions much more easily. The coolant can be used as a moderator, such as heavy water, as the coolant can help slow down the neutrons to thermal speeds, but it is not necessary, as a solid moderator, such as graphite, can be used instead. In a fast reactor, the chain reaction is sustained purely through fast fission neutron capture, which is much more difficult, and thus often requires highly enriched nuclear fuel.
	The enrichment of the fuel determines the ratio of fissile fuel to nonfissile fuel, such as the ratio of U-235 (which is fissile) to U-238 (which is depleted uranium, and has great difficulty undergoing fission, and usually is assumed unable to achieve fission). A higher enrichment obviously increases the neutron multiplication rate.
	In order to control the reactor, controls rods are used, which are neutron poisons, or materials which absorb neutrons, reducing the effectiveness of the chain reaction. These control rods are raised and lowered into the reactor in order to control the reaction criticality, which is the rate at which neutrons in the core increase or decrease. Thus, with the control rods removed, the core should be supercritical, or increasing in neutron amounts, and with all the control rods are inserted, the core should be subcritical, or decreasing in neutron amounts. This means the core can be powered on, sustained at a constant power, or powered off properly, simply by adding or removing the control rods.
	The criticality constant, or effective neutron multiplication factor, is controlled by six factors which are multiplied together, known as the six factor formula. A multiplication factor of 1 means in each neutron generation, the number of neutrons remains constant, or critical, and is used for sustaining power. If greater than 1, the neutrons are increasing with each generation, for powering on, and if it is less than 1, the neutrons are dying out with each generation, for powering off. The six factors are:
	Fast Neutron Non-Leakage - The probability that a fast neutron will not leak out of the core. It is controlled by the geometry of the reactor (larger reactors are able to control leakage much better), and by using core elements which can absorb fast neutrons better.
	Thermal Neutron Non-Leakage - The probability that a thermal neutron will not leak out of the core. It is controlled by the geometry again, and by the core element thermal neutron absorption cross sections.
	Reproduction Factor - Also called the Thermal Fission Factor, this is the number of neutrons produced by each fission on average. It varies based on what sort of fuel you use, and on how enriched your fuel is.
	Thermal Utilization Factor - The probability that a thermal neutron will be absorbed by the fuel rather than by any other core element. It varies based on how much fuel there is volumetrically compared to the rest of the core elements, and also how great of an absorption cross section the fuel has compared to the rest of the core elements.
	Resonance Escape Probability - This is the fraction of fast neutrons that manage to slow down to thermal speeds without being absorbed, and is directly affected by the effectiveness of your neutron moderator, which needs a very high resonance integral neutron cross section to work effectively.
	Fast Fission Factor - This is a factor which relates the total fissions to thermal fissions, and is also dependent on the resonance integral cross sections of all core elements.



Concept Ultimate Simulation Limitations	Ultimate Simulation Limitations
Concept Ultimate Simulation Limitations Description
	Children of a Dead Earth is a simulation of what near future space warfare and space travel would actually be like. It is a simulation, and involves a number of approximations for the sake of performance, simplicity, or relevance. This game is as close to reality as possible without sacrificing those three things, and no "handwavium" or "unknown futuristic devices" are implemented for the sake of gameplay, graphics, or story. This section has no relevance to gameplay, and is only intended to be read by those who understand the underlying equations and science of this game. Below are the inaccuracies and limitations of this simulation at simulating reality:
	- All materials are treated as being isotropic.
	- All material properties are temperature invariant. For materials where this is important, the less ideal values are always used. For instance, if an alloy will be used at very high temperatures and its tensile strength is significantly lower at those temperatures, that alloy is simply treated as having the lower tensile strength.
	- Nuclear device explosive lenses appear to be classified, and the author was unable to find proper equations for that part of nuclear weaponry, so the equations for it are fictional, but created to approximate actual real world data on nuclear weapons.
	- Nuclear reactors are all implemented using the homogenous reactor equation, rather than with the more accurate heterogenous reactor equations.
	- No spacecraft systems use the finite elements method to determine heating, stress, electromagnetic fields, etc., instead opting for steady state equations, except in the case of calculating weapon projectile exit velocities, and also in the case of determining damage to spacecraft armor.
	- Orbital calculations are approximate (obviously, since the N-body problem is unsolved), and use a 4th order symplectic integrator to solve orbital states.
	- Atmospheric drag is not accounted for, since the entire game takes place in space, rather than in atmospheres, or on terrestrial surfaces. Thus, aerobraking is not possible in this simulation.
	- A number of material properties could not be found for a lot of different materials, and thus were estimated based on the interpolation of properties of similar materials.
	- Solar storms, and space weather, are not accounted for in this simulation.
	- Relativistic effects are not accounted for, as all speeds of spacecraft will be newtonian, and only at extremely close distances to the sun will general relativity's effects be noticable (at least for this solar system).
	- Many spacecraft systems rely on equations that were derived from research data at much smaller scales than are present in this simulation, since data at the scale present in this simulation has never been researched. For example, real life Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters have never been tested in the multi-Megawatt, or Gigawatt range, but you can build such thrusters in this simulation (just watch out for the Onset Phenomenon!).
	- Many thermodynamic processes are treated as adiabatic processes. The only exceptions are when thermodynamic losses are very significant and measurable.
	- Most gases are treated as ideal gases.

Concept Unlocking Content and Mods	Unlocking Content and Mods
Concept Unlocking Content and Mods Description
	Most of the content in Children of a Dead Earth is locked away initially, and must be unlocked by progressing through the game levels. This is because the sheer depth of the science involved in the inner workings of the game can be overwhelming to new players.
	However, some players, such as scientists and engineers, may not be interested in progressing through the levels of the game, and may wish to only explore the scientific parts of the game,ly ship design and module design. For those players, all non-level content can be unlocked here if they so choose, using the button at the bottom of this article.
	If you choose to do so, be advised that although you can design your own modules, weapons, thrusters, and so on, as well as your own ships, you will not be able to use them in the campaign until you would reach a point where you would have actually unlocked ship and module design. However, you may always still try out your designs in the sandbox mode.
	Concerning mods, Children of a Dead Earth limits itself to near future technologies in order to remain as plausible as possible, and because only near future technologies have had significant analysis of all of their stresses and limitations. However, modders may be interested in using the Children of a Dead Earth engine for experimenting with untested, hypothetical, or even fictitious technologies.
	To that end, Children of a Dead Earth supports mod support directly in game, and this is also unlocked here. This allows creation of 'Black Box' technologies in Module Design, which are not necessarily limited by scientific constraints. Enabling mods causes Black Box Engines and Black Box Weapons to both be created in Module Design as new designs in Engines and Weapons respectively.

Concept Steam Workshop	Steam Workshop
Concept Steam Workshop Description
	Steam Workshop is supported as of version 1.1.2.0. After subscribing to a Steam Workshop Item, you must restart the game for the item to be loaded in.
	You can make Steam Workshop Items in two ways: Uploading individual modules or ships and their dependencies as a single Workshop Item, or uploading an arbitrary group of files as a Workshop Item.
	To upload an individual module or ship, this option can be found at the bottom right corner buttons of ship and module design, next to the export button.
	To upload an arbitrary group of files as a Workshop Item, use the button on this screen. All files located in the Mods/WorkshopExport/ folder will be exported. It should mimic the file structure of the game data to correctly be loaded in as a mod. For example, 'Mods/WorkshopExport/Data/AI.txt'. You will have to edit the preview image, title, and description in Steam Workshop itself.
	If you wish to overwrite an existing Workshop Item (for instance, if you're updating a mod you've uploaded previously), you must put a file called 'WorkshopID.txt' in the Mods/ folder (not the WorkshopExport folder). In this file, there must only be a number which is the Steam Workshop Item ID. You can find the ID of your existing Workshop Items in your web browser's address when inspecting the item.
	To customize the upload thumbnail, you need to save an image called 'Preview' (plus extension) in the Mods folder. It MUST be less than 1 MB and can only be a jpg, png, or bmp.



Concept The Cataclysm	The Cataclysm
Concept The Cataclysm Subject	Doctrine
Concept The Cataclysm Description
	Most of our military commanders are mandated to know the history of our great Republic. What follows is an abridged version of where our faction traces its origins to. It has its roots in The Cataclysm.
	It is unclear how The Cataclysm started, but most experts assume it began with contentions over resources, land, or ideology. The two conglomerate states of old Earth, the North Eurasian Socialist Republic (NESR), and the East Asian Megastate (EAM), declared war on one another. Both sides cited vastly different reasons for entering the conflict, and in any case, the truth was distorted so much that it is unclear which would be most to blame. Or if a third party played both sides to initiate the conflict.
	Regardless, both sides had nuclear weapons, yet both states had pledged to nuclear weapon ban treaties that they wouldn't use them against one another. Most of the other countries were quite content to sit on the sidelines and spout platitudes about "restraint" while the two nations tore each other apart.
	With absurd amounts of conventional weaponry, including explosives on par with nuclear weapons, the two nations began a war, one that the EAM quickly took control of. They overwhelmed NESR troops with sheer numbers, and was rapidly encroached on the NESR capital.
	Not keen on suffering complete collapse, the NESR responded to this threat against its capital by detonating several gigatons of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the EAM. It triggered massive tsunamis, destroying a tremendous amount of infrastructure, and causing mass causalties of civilians across the EAM. Other non-allied states such as Japan, Australia, and to a lesser degree, the United States, all suffered damage from the tsunamis.
	The NESR claimed that it didn't directly attack with a nuclear weapon, that it simply was striking the ocean, so it was well within the bounds of the treaty. Other nations were enraged at the collateral damage, yet they still were not keen on joining the fray.
	The EAM, in retaliation, detonated several megatons in space above the north pole, triggering a massive EMP blast across the entire north hemisphere. The NESR's entire electrical grid went dead, as did much of the rest of the northern hemisphere. Again, the attack was not directly against the enemy, it was an attack on the atmosphere, so it was technically within the bounds of the nuclear weapon ban treaty. At this, point, most northern hemisphere nations were enraged at the EAM as well. And then the EAM seized the NESR capital.
	The NESR, in a move of desperation (still not using nuclear weapons), executed their final fallback plan to coat the icecaps with a thin layer of ash, reducing the albedo of the icecaps. The icecaps absorbed more light than normal, heating up and melting them, which caused the albedo to fall even more, triggering a positive feedback loop of the icecaps melting until they were completely seawater. China's entire eastern seaboard was wiped out, and a huge portion of the country submerged underwater. As was parts of the United States, portions of India, large parts of Europe and South America. Entire countries were submerged and wiped out over the course of days. At this point, no country could really feel any rage. They only felt fear. By now, the war seemed to be at a standstill, with millions of civilians freezing to death or drowned, and millions more people across the world dead as well. Yet, in a move of unfettered perseverance, the NESR military retook control of their capital and then began marching on the remains of the EAM.
	Unfortunately for the world, the EAM had one more fallback plan, and still refused to back down. The EAM's various asteroid mining companies all had ties to the EAM government, and one asteroid in particular was diverted to hit the NESR mainland. For some foolish reason, they still didn't want to break the nuclear weapons treaty. And so they instead weaponized an asteroid. And no faction in the northern hemisphere could launch any nuclear weapons to try and stop it, because all of their electronic sensing and targeting equipment had yet to have been repaired from the damage of the EMP.
	The rock was just big enough to leave a giant crater in the NESR, and just small enough that it wouldn't do appreciable damage to the EAM. Of course, the earthquakes that were triggered as a result of this did more than enough damage to the EAM anyways. And to the rest of the world. And then the crater filled with ocean water, triggering a wobble in Earth's rotation, causing seismic activity across the entire globe. At this point, most nations, developed or not, were in a postapocalyptic hell. Any and all power grids across the world were completely disrupted, and entire cities were leveled by earthquakes or were now at the bottom of the ocean.
	But the worst was yet to come. The dark ash and dust kicked up by the asteroid hung in the atmosphere, and absorbed more and more sunlight, heating up the atmosphere until a runaway greenhouse effect took place. It is estimated that, had the majority of the world's infrastructure been still intact, various plans could've been executed to reverse this heating effect. But most developed nations were now standing on top of a pile shattered cities and weeping souls. And so it was determined that the cheapest plan was to evacuate the earth.
	At the time the United States, Japan, India, and Pakistan collectively had six undamaged supersonic skyhooks. They had survived due to remaining high in the atmosphere away from the carnage. The EAM's and NESR's skyhooks had been the first thing destroyed in the war. The skyhooks had been used them to sling material into Low Earth Orbit to send to their various space stations, the moon city, or to the newly formed Mars colony. And now every country was clambering to use them to dump people offworld. The LEO (Low Earth Orbit) space station cities were flooded with refugees from Earth. Space construction companies sprung up and flourished as they tried to build more and more habitats in LEO and on Luna. Enormous volumes of algae and other biomass were scooped from the ocean and the Earth's surface to try to offset the impending oxygen and nutrient needs.
	Meanwhile, billions of people were dying of starvation as the entire staple food market collapsed under the increasing heat. And millions more died in orbit due to food or oxygen shortages, the bodies converted into compost to supply food for the rest of the refugees.
	In the span of under a decade, a fraction of a billion people were evacuated to LEO, Luna, or even Mars. The other billions all perished, and Earth turned into another Venus. The oceans boiled off, and all remaining living things evaporated. Although its distance from the sun made it somewhat cooler than Venus, it still struck a fiery hot and utterly inhospitable equilibrium.
	Just like that, the cradle of humanity was no more. Shrouded in hatred and hubris, this planet, and it's thousands of years of human culture, a symbol of humanity's progress, was now just a tombstone, a reminder of the fragility of it all. A dire warning of how easy existence can just vanish, and how utterly responsible we are for our own destruction. And humanity was left as nothing more than a mass of orphans trying to carve out a living in the solar system, children of a dead Earth.

Concept Diplomacy	Diplomacy
Concept Diplomacy Subject	Doctrine
Concept Diplomacy Description
	As the war begins to heat up, we encourage all of our commanders to read up on our military doctrine. Below is a short outline on our place in the war.
	For us, the Republic of the Free People, we emphasize that the enemy is not made of monsters. The enemy is composed of human beings, human soldiers, human captains, human admirals, human politicians, and human civilians. Just like us. They are not cartoon villians, and we are not cartoon heroes. Or villians. In the end, the USTA simply wants to protect their faction, their people, their culture. We want to protect our faction, our people, our culture. We want to survive, to thrive, to live at peace, and flourish, just like them.
	Truth is, nobody wants war. Not us, not them.
	So why aren't we engaging in diplomacy, sending out ambassadors, and trying to negotiate peace terms, like civilized human beings?
	We could. They could, as well. The thing is, although this undeclared war is a very recent phenomenon, its roots have been brewing for decades at least. The USTA understands, like us, that the only way to truly guarantee one's own survival is to ensure no one else exists. A faction is unpredictable, and being at peace now can change the instant government leadership changes hands. The USTA tries to guarantee this by being the only solar superpower. They invest tremendous amounts of money into their military spending in order to ensure military superiority.
	And now there's us, the Republic of the Free People, the only other faction capable of being a equal, economically, and militaristically. At least, as the years have dragged on, we have been slowly catching up, both in terms of GDP, and in terms of military might. And that scares the USTA. They foresaw a future where our economy crushes theirs, where we are bigger, better than them. They knew that right now we have had little interest in warmongering. But what if, suddenly, our people elect a new, militaristic president, and peace transforms into to war in one election cycle?
	Well, then the USTA's survival would be jeopardized. The USTA is not shortsighted, they foresaw that possibility, and it terrified them. You may say they were paranoid, but every faction should be very concerned about their survival. And that's why they began claiming numerous asteroids in the belt, trying to acquire more territory, more resources, in order to stay ahead of us, in order to keep their economy on top. These blatantly aggressive tactics were not done because the USTA is evil, or unjust. They simply were afraid, and were taking steps to stop this frightening future from ever happening.
	On top of that, the USTA have been recently implementing sanctions, utterly halting their fissile trade with us over the last few years. In the coming years, that will cripple every spaceship we build, be it military or civilian. Our analysts predict that, with their economic sanctions, in under a decade our entire trade economy will collapse, tremendous starvation will occur across our many moons, and our faction will splinter into disparate states, each dependent on the USTA for food and air. That would be their ideal result of all of this.
	The only real way out that we can see is war. Neither of us want to engage in war, but we're doing so out of the best interest of our own factions. The USTA would only accept peace if we were weaker, splintered, and unable to challenge their might. We would only accept peace if we could stand as an equal to them.
	So war it must be. And we intend to see this war through to the bitter end.

Concept Warfare	Warfare
Concept Warfare Subject	Doctrine
Concept Warfare Description
	Understanding our Republic Space Force's military philosophy is crucial to understanding the orders that the high command gives. What follows is a quick run through of said doctrine.
	The primary philosophy behind how this Republic engages in warfare can be summed up with one word: Survival.
	We're here to win this war, not to simply stalemate, because a stalement leaves us open for attack in the future. To utterly crush our opponent, to utterly annihilate our enemy, is the only possible way to ensure survival.
	It follows then, that there is no tactic too dirty, too underhanded for us. Concepts such as honor, diginity, and fairness are all ridiculous in the face of death. It is often said that it is only when you're staring down a salvo of nuclear missiles making a beeline for you, that you finally grasp how meaningless fighting fair truly is.
	Fiction would have us believe that the people who fight dirty always lose, as if the universe is looking out for the virtuous, rewarding the good while punishing the wicked. But in reality, the universe doesn't care. The people who fight the dirtiest gain the greatest advantage. The ruthless win, and the virtuous falter. This is not because the universe wants the wicked to win; it is simply that fighting dirty is a more efficient combat style than fighting clean. And when one's objective is survivial, one will always want the most efficient combat style.
	One might observe that this is a very amoral point of view, and this is true. But morals are irrelevant if one are dead. If one is unable to survive, then holding on to virtues are meaningless. One is only afforded the luxury of being able to wax philosophically about right and wrong if one is alive.
	And until our faction's survival can be guaranteed, you can bet that morality, and fighting fair, will always be off the table.

Concept The People Description
	Due to transparency concerns from numerous Admirals in our ranks, high command has decided to publish a document concerning this matter. Please read it below if you are similarly concerned.
	The people we serve, the civilians of the Republic of the Free People, know little about what goes on in this war except what our tightly controlled news outlets yield them. High command believe it's for the best.
	Throughout history, whenever civilians get a front row seat to the horrors of war, they riot, they protest, and they try to stop the war. This republic can't afford such a thing. After all, what would happen if our citizens would riot and stop our war effort, while the enemy's citizens did not? We would lose the war quite rapidly. Our people don't grasp the nuances of why we fight, of why the actions we take are necessary, no matter how terrible. They only see the violence, the destruction, the suffering, and immediately lock onto that, their emotions overriding any chance at trying to tease apart the nuances of the situation. The citizens' shortsightened emotional appeasement might actually cost them their livelihoods, or even their lives.
	So, the military pulls the wool over their eyes, gives them a rosy picture of what is happening during the war, and keeps their information sources locked down and tightly monitored. This is not out of malice.
	We are not enemies of our people, we're not trying to hurt them, or wrong them. Everything we do, we do for them, for their well being, for their safety. In a sense, we're protecting them from themselves. And we will do terrible things for their safety.
	Now, one might think that these people would not want terrible things done for their sake. The people themselves will tell you that, too. But they don't actually stand behind that sentiment. You see, most of the solar system's middle class is built on the backs of the poor. These middle class people enjoy the wonders and comforts of modern technology, and all the luxurious foods, expensive bling, and high quality porn they could ever dream of need. Enough entertainment to last a century.
	But it all comes at the expense of the less fortunate. Ice collector kids (kids consume less oxygen, after all) working the rings of Saturn, working jobs where a small air leak means the kids suffocate and get quickly replaced; the dead kids are quickly flushed out the airlock to save on mass ratio. Sex slaves trafficked from across the solar system to Europa to create the most lucrative porn, and service the most deviant and illegal sexual fantasies of the sex tourists there. The ESL_5 Station workers, working the huge swaths farmland to provide fresh meat and vegetables for the whole solar system, indebted to a life of poverty and servitude.
	There's no such thing as a free lunch, and for our people to be able to have their creature comforts, someone has to pay, of course.
	The average person will scream their lungs out about the terrible conditions of the factory workers on Ganymede who work in nearly slave labor conditions to make shoes. But ask them to give up their own shoes, and they will balk, and make excuses, and flaunt their cognitive dissonance. Everyone wants to be compassionate until it actually costs them something.
	Despite what they will claim, the average person actually prefers this life of living on the backs of others, to a life of equality among people. If you give the average person the choice between a life of leisure built on the backs of starving children and impoverished laborers, and a life of struggle, guess which one they choose? It seems the desire for an easy life trumps a guilty conscience any day of the week. People motivated to help others at the expense of themselves are an oddity, a fluke in the ways of human culture. They appear from time to time, make noise, get recorded in a footnote in the history books, and then die off. And they are far too few to actually make a difference.
	This reality is why we convince our people that the war is just, and civil. If they knew the truth, they would protest, and kick up a fuss, crippling our economy. Then, when the enemy invades and subjugates them all, they would beg for forgiveness, but by then, it would be too late. They want their life of comfort, even if at the cost of millions of deaths of people they don't know, but they'll never admit it.
	That's what we're here for. To let them live in their lie, to tell them that they're not thriving on the suffering of others, even though they are, and that is exactly what they want. To protect them, to serve them. To give them exactly the kind of life they want, the kind of life they will never admit to wanting.

Concept War Crimes Description
	Should we lose this war, in all likelihood, we would be tried as war criminals for the actions we have taken to win. Rest assured we discounted no course of action because it was unconscionable. We're here to win the war, and any acts of kindness or compassion will have to wait until we have succeeded.
	This is no different than any war throughout human history. The winning side of any wartime conflict often gets free reign to try and execute enemy leaders for war crimes, because both sides often commit countless atrocities each. The only difference is that the winning side gets to sweep their atrocities under the carpet, and rewrite history, all while exposing all the atrocities of the enemy for the world to see. It's how war works.
	Every civilized faction tries their best not to commit crimes against humanity. We try not to. The USTA tries not to. But soldiers and officers are deviant, and war tends to attract the worst kind of people. And so these atrocities get committed, and for the sake of the support of civilians at home, the good people above them have to cover up the atrocities. And because we can't risk losing valuable soldiers and officers during the war, we slap the offenders on the wrist. A court marshal, a firm warning, but nothing major. Nothing that would hinder our war effort.
	And it's not just them. There are many situations where the enemy deliberately tries to provoke war crimes from us. They hide military troops among civilian cities and space stations. They conceal their war machines in civilan transports. And thus when we destroy a military target, a couple thousand civilians die as collateral. They simply tried to take every advantage they could, and we tried our best to stop that advantage, and several thousand innocent women and men die as a consequence.
	And finally, always remember that war crimes can often be very effective in wartime. If we're here to win, you can bet we're going to take try to take every possible advantage we can. Simply remember that we're not here to destroy, to do evil, to cause suffering. War crimes are a side effect of trying to win in every possible way we can. They are a means, not an end.
	So atrocities are inevitable, that much is clear. This means that the only thing we can do is hope we win the war, so that we can erase our atrocities from history.
	And should we be forced to answer for our atrocities when the war is won? No. It would splinter our people. If our people discovered the lengths we took to win the war, they'd be horrified. They don't realize the gravity of the situation. And they'd call for us and most of the military's top brass to be executed. And it would weaken our victory, and give the enemy a chance to rise up once again. Maybe decades after the enemy has securely capitulated could we admit such things.
	But rest assured that there would be no true justice. When you yourself carry out orders to commit crimes against humanity, you would be just following orders. And your superior would be following orders as well. But everyone in the chain of command does in fact share some of the responsibility. The Nuremberg trials have taught us that much.
	We're all a little responsible for the terrors we've created. Even the politicians at home who funded the war, and the people who elected them, and even our civilians who cry out for jingoism from their safe little homes. They all share a tiny piece of the responsibility for the actions we take.
	But human beings don't like that. They want someone to blame. They like to be able to pin all their problems on a single person, or a single group of people. That small group of people are evil, blame them. Everyone else, we're okay, we're decent folk, we didn't have any hand in these terrible things.
	A truly fair tribunal of the crimes committed against humanity would convict much of the human race, but that's not feasible nor possible. The military commanders at the top get the blame, and history goes on, without the humans underneath grasping just how deep the web of hate is woven. In this sense, there will never be any true justice for any war crimes that ever will be committed.
	In the end, war crimes have been committed and will continue to be committed until this war is over. All that you can and should do is make sure we're the ones who end as the victors.
